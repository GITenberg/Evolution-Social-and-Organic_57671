<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The contents of this volume consist of the
first ten lectures of the thirty-five in the Winter
course of 1907–08. They were delivered in
the Garrick Theater, Chicago, on Sunday mornings
to crowded houses. On several occasions
half as many people were turned away as
managed to get in. If these lectures meet with
as warm a reception when read as they did
when heard, I shall be more than satisfied. For
a fuller discussion of the Greek period, briefly
dealt with in the first lecture, see Edward
Clodd’s “Pioneers of Evolution” to which work
the early part of this lecture is greatly indebted.</p>

<p>Every lecture proceeds on the assumption,
that a knowledge of the natural sciences, and
especially the great revolutionizing generalizations
which they have revealed, is indispensable
to a modern education.</p>

<p>This position is by no means new. It pervades
the classic literature of Socialism
throughout. Liebknecht, speaking of Marx
and himself says: “Soon we were on the field
of Natural Science, and Marx ridiculed the
victorious reaction in Europe that fancied it
had smothered the revolution and did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
suspect that Natural Science was preparing a
new revolution.”</p>

<p>The only thing I have succeeded in doing
which is at all new, is presenting these so-called
heavy subjects in a way that attracts
and retains a large and enthusiastic audience
Sunday after Sunday eight months of the year.</p>

<p>These lectures, nothwithstanding their
phenomenal success, have aroused some opposition,
in certain quarters among Socialists.
This opposition arises almost wholly from the
fact that the Socialists in question have yet to
learn what their own standard literature contains.
When they make that discovery they
will be obliged to do one of two things, reject
the Socialist philosophy or cease opposing its
public presentation.</p>

<p>A second thought will show that they may
do neither. There is a type of brain the
specimens of which are very numerous, which
seems to possess the faculty of keeping different
kinds of knowledge and contradictory
ideas, in separate, water-tight compartments.
Thus, as these ideas never come together there
is no collision.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous example of this is the
man who accepts and openly proclaims the
truth of the materialistic conception of history—the
theory that, among other things, explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the origin, functions, and changes of religion,
just as it does those of law—yet the very man
who boasts of his concurrence in this epoch-making
theory, using one lobe of his brain,
will, while using the other lobe, and with still
greater fervency, maintain that the Socialist
philosophy has nothing to do with religion at
all, but is an “economic” question only. The
left lobe knows not what the right lobe is
doing. Dietzgen described these Comrades as
“dangerous muddle-heads.” He might have
omitted the adjective. A brain of this order
renders its possessor harmless.</p>

<p>These well-meaning friends have offered a
great deal of advice as to how to conduct our
meeting without “driving people away.” Yet
strangely enough our audience grew by leaps
and bounds, until from seventy-five at the
first lecture we are now crowding and often
overcrowding one of the largest and finest
theaters inside the loop. Meanwhile they
followed their own advice and saw what was
at the beginning a fine audience of five hundred
grow less and less until it is less than fifty and
sometimes falls below thirty. This does not
seem to justify the cry that the working class
is hungering for Christian Socialism.</p>

<p>Further volumes of these lectures will carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
the theories of Socialism into yet other fields
of science and philosophy.</p>

<p>In conclusion let me ask a certain type of
correspondents to save my time and their own.
They say they agree with my views entirely;
there is no question but I am right. And the
lectures would be in place if delivered before
university men. But workingmen (my top-lofty
correspondents not included of course)
have so many ignorant prejudices that fearless
scientific teaching is not acceptable to them.
The size of my audience is sufficient disproof
of the last statement. As to the rest, it is just
the existence of ignorant prejudices that makes
the fearless teaching of science necessary.
Again, I have yet to be convinced that there is
any kind of knowledge which is good for
university men, but unfit for workingmen.
Moreover, I positively refuse to have one kind
of knowledge for myself, and another to give
out to my audience. This is the fundamental
principle of priestcraft, and the working class
has had far too much of it already.</p>

<p>On this ground—that there is nothing higher
than reality, that Socialism is in harmony with
all reality and that in the end reality must
triumph—the future lectures of these courses
will stand or fall.</p>

<p>“Early ideas,” says Herbert Spencer, “are
usually vague adumbrations of the truth,” and
however numerous may be the exceptions, this
was undoubtedly the case with the evolutionary
speculations of the ancient Greeks.
The greatness of that remarkable republic finds
one of its most striking manifestations in the
fact that so many great modern ideas trace
their ancestry back to Greece. Sir Henry
Maine, the historical jurist, said that, “except
the blind forces of nature, nothing moves that
is not Greek in its origin.” Compared with her
dreamy oriental neighbors, Greece shone like a
meteor in a moonless night. As Professor
Burnet says, “They left off telling tales. They
gave up the hopeless task of describing what
was, when as yet there was nothing, and asked
instead what all things really are now,” while
the Oriental shrunk from the search after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
causes, looking, as Professor Butcher aptly
remarks “on each fresh gain of earth as so
much robbery of heaven.”</p>

<p>The Greeks very largely discarded the theological
mind, peopled with its pious phantasms,
and sought to probe into the nature of the
material universe. This is why we discover a
fairly distinct, and sometimes startlingly clear
“adumbration” of the theory of evolution
running like a chain of gold through the immortal
fragments of their greatest thinkers.</p>

<p>What is it that really is, and what that only
seems to be? What is real, and what is only
apparent? This is the theme which Greek philosophy
has in common with modern thought,
and this is why the remnants of Greek literature
are so precious in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Thales, of Miletus, in Asia Minor, is conceded
to have been the founder of Greek philosophy.
“He asserted water to be the principle
of all things,” says Diogenes Laertius, and he
regarded all life as coming from water, a position
by no means foreign to modern science.</p>

<p>Anaximander, also a Milesian and a younger
contemporary of Thales, who like him flourished
between 500 and 600 B. C., said that the
material cause of all things was the Infinite.
“It is neither water nor any other of what are
now called the elements, but a substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
different from them which is infinite, from
which arise all the heavens and the worlds
within them.” “Man,” he boldly asserts, “is
like another animal, namely, a fish, in the beginning,”
a shrewd guess which is now an
established fact.</p>

<p>Anaximenes, the third and last of the
Milesian philosophers, while following his
predecessors closely in time, disagreed with
them as to the raw material of the universe.
He declares it to be air which, “when it is
dilated so as to be rarer becomes fire while
winds, on the other hand, are condensed air,
Cloud is formed from air by ‘felting’ and this,
still further condensed, becomes water. Water,
condensed still more, turns to earth; and when
condensed as much as it can be, to stones.”
All of which proves that Anaximenes had a
very fertile brain.</p>

<p>Herakleitos, one of the greatest of all Greek
thinkers, lived for a time at Ephesus and expressed
the following forceful opinion of his
fellow citizens: “The Ephesians would do well
to hang themselves, every grown man of them,
and leave the city to beardless youths; for they
have cast out Hermodoros, the best man
among them, saying: ‘We will have none who
is best among us; if there be any such, let him
be so elsewhere and among others.’” According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
to him everything comes from and returns
to fire and “all things are in a state of flux like
a river.” Here is the intellectual ancestor of
Hegel with his great saying. “Nothing is,
everything is becoming.” Herakleitos sagaciously
observed: “You cannot step twice into
the same rivers, for fresh waters are ever flowing
in upon you.”</p>

<p>Parmenides, born at Elea about 515 B. C.,
was poet and philosopher both, and insisted in
his hexameter verse that the universe is a
unity, which neither came out of nothing, nor
could, in any degree, pass away, thus anticipating
by over 2,000 years Lavoisier’s
doctrine of the permanence of matter.</p>

<p>Empedocles, of Akragas in Sicily, about the
same time, stated this great truth with still
greater force and clearness: “Fools!—for they
have no far-reaching thoughts—who deem that
what before was not, comes into being or that
aught can perish and be utterly destroyed. For
it cannot be that aught can arise from what in
no way is, and it is impossible and unheard of
that what is should perish; for it will always
be, wherever one may keep putting it.” He
also endeavored to combine and reconcile the
ideas of some of his predecessors, teaching that
all things come from four roots—water, air,
fire and earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Anaxagoras, born about 500 B. C., was the
first Greek to suffer for science. He was
brought to trial for asserting the sun to be a
red hot stone, and it would have probably gone
hard with him had not the mighty Pericles
been his friend. If the sun was merely a fiery
ball, what became of the religion founded on
the worship of Apollo?</p>

<p>Nearly a half a century earlier Xenophanes,
of Colophon, had ventilated ideas much
more obnoxious to the priests. He had
done for his age what Feuerbach did
to the Nineteenth century—he had explained
the origin of the gods by Anthropomorphism.
Said he: “If oxen or lions had hands,
and could paint with their hands and produce
works of art as men do, horses would
paint the forms of the gods like horses and
oxen like oxen. Each would represent them
with bodies according to the form of each. So
the Ethiopians make their gods black and
snubnosed; the Thracians give theirs red hair
and blue eyes.” Had Xenophanes lived at
Athens, where a religious revival had just
taken place, he would have shared the fate
which later overtook the impious Socrates.
Luckily for Xenophanes, in the colony where
he lived “the gods were left to take care of
themselves.” Anaxagoras was the first to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
determine what causes the eclipses and the
illumination of the moon:—“The moon has not
a light of her own but gets it from the sun.
The moon is eclipsed by the earth screening
the sun’s light from it. The sun is eclipsed at
the new moon, when the moon screens it from
us.”</p>

<p>The Pythagoreans who must be distinguished
from the medicine man Pythagoras,
from whom they only take their name indirectly,
and not as disciples, believed the reality of
the universe was to be found in numbers.
They were deceived into this absurdity by the
exactness of mathematical conclusions. This
was excusable among the Greeks to whom
arithmetical combinations were as wonderful
as electrical phenomena are to us, but its revival
in our day by astrologers and theosophists
has no such justification.</p>

<p>Socrates, born about 470 B. C., at Athens, is
described as “pug-nosed, thick-lipped, big-bellied
and bulging-eyed”—the very opposite
of the Greek ideal of beauty. He believed that
knowledge itself would bring virtue, and
sought to discover the true ground of knowledge.
His search brought him into conflict
with the religious bigotry of his day and he
was finally sentenced to death and died from
drinking hemlock in 399 B. C. He wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
nothing and his work is preserved mainly
through his influence on Plato.</p>

<p>Leukippos and Demokritos are linked together
through their statements of the atomic
theory, made more than twenty centuries before
Dalton. They placed the permanent
reality of things in numberless atoms, of which
Leukippos said “there are an infinite number
of them, and they are invisible owing to the
smallness of their bulk.”</p>

<p>Plato we shall pass by; his metaphysical doctrine
of ideas contributed little of value to the
solution of the riddle of the universe.</p>

<p>We now come to the great Stagirite, Aristotle,
founder of the experimental school and
father of natural history. Born in 384 B. C., he
entered the Academy under Plato when a boy
of eighteen. When he was thirty-six Plato
died, and Aristotle then left Athens. At forty-one
he became the teacher of Alexander the
Great. He was the greatest of all the Greeks,
and his studies took a wider range than had
been embraced by any previous thinker.</p>

<p>Stageira, where he spent his boyhood, was
on the Strynomid gulf, and here he observed
the variations and gradations between marine
plants and animals. It is an evidence of his
keen insight that he classified the sponge as an
animal. Compare this with Agassiz, the opponent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of Darwinism, who, in the 19th century,
declared the sponge to be a vegetable.</p>

<p>Aristotle insisted on observation and experience
as the foundation of knowledge. “We
must not accept a general principle from logic
only, but must prove its application to each
fact. For it is in facts we must seek general
principles, and these must always accord with
facts.” He repudiated the idea of purpose in
nature, saying, “Jupiter rains not that corn may
be increased, but from necessity.” He came
very near Von Mohl’s protoplasm when he
said, “Germs should have been first produced,
and not immediately animals; and that soft
mass which first subsisted was the germ.”</p>

<p>Passing over the much misrepresented Epicurus
we come two centuries later to the
illustrious Roman poet philosopher, Lucretius.
In this last century preceeding the Christian
era, Greece had fallen from her high estate and
become a Roman province. But while Rome
had annexed Greece, Greek learning had conquered
the Roman mind.</p>

<p>Lucretius in his poem, “The System of Nature,”
expounds, with great force, the atomic
theory of his Greek forerunners. The first
anthropologist, he comes so near to Spencer
and Tylor that his ideas, and sometimes even
his sentences smack of the 19th century. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
past history of man” he asserts, “lies in no
heroic or golden age, but in one struggle out
of savagery.” Of the origin of language he
says, “Nature impelled them to utter the
various sounds of the tongue, and use struck
out the names of things.” Of the early
struggles of primitive men he says, “Man’s
first arms were hands, nails and teeth and
stones and boughs broken off from the forests,
and flame and fire, as soon as they had become
known. Afterward the force of iron and copper
was discovered, and the use of copper was
known before that of iron, as its nature is
easier to work, and it is found in greater
quantity. With copper they would labor the
soil of the earth and stir up the billows of war.
Then by slow steps the sword of iron gained
ground and the make of the copper sickle became
a byword.” The name of Lucretius
closes the long line of the evolutionary pioneers
of the ancient world. There the golden
vein ceases so far as thinking is concerned, not
to reappear until many centuries have passed.</p>

<p>With the decline and fall of the Roman empire,
and the rise to power of Christianity,
learning was driven from Europe and found
refuge among the Arabians. This brings us
to the dark or middle ages. It is in the interpretation
of the phenomena of this period, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
bourgeois free thinkers like Clodd and Draper
break down. They tacitly assume that in
Europe evolution was suspended for over a
thousand years; and all because of the Christian
church. They fail to recognize that deeper
cause, the medieval form of wealth production,
which gave the church its power to repress
learning in the interest of the lords of the land,
among which the church herself was greatest;
owning as she did one-third of the soil of
Europe.</p>

<p>The bourgeois radical cannot perceive that
during this period social processes were being
gradually transformed and that an economic
foundation was being laid that would make
possible the renaissance and put science in an
impregnable position, and make the progressive
acceptance of evolution inevitable.
Engels says: “The Middle Ages were reckoned
as a mere interruption of history by a thousand
years of barbarism. The great advances
of the Middle Ages—the broadening of
European learning, the bringing into existence
of great nations, which arose, one after the
other, and finally the enormous technical advances
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries—all
this no one saw”.</p>

<p>But it cannot be denied that this was a
terrible period for any thinker who had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
misfortune to be born in it. All that was great
and noble in the thought of Greece and Rome
was rigorously suppressed. The “perfecting
principle” of Aristotle was wrested to theological
uses. An emaciated form of his philosophy,
and a literal interpretation of the scriptures,
constituted the only permissible studies. Outside
this dilution of Aristotle, the only thing in
Greek thought which appealed to the medieval
mind was the Pythagorean mystical use of
numbers. The conclusions reached by that
method were truly remarkable, especially when
we remember that they engaged such notable
men as Augustine, the celebrated Bishop of
Hippo.</p>

<p>These are examples: Because there are three
persons in the trinity, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, three orders in the church, bishops
priests and deacons; three degrees of attainment,
light, purity and knowledge; three
virtues, faith, hope and charity, and three eyes
in a honeybee; therefore, there can only be
three colors, red, yellow and blue. Because
there were seven churches in the apocalypse,
seven golden candlesticks, seven cardinal
virtues, seven deadly sins and seven sacraments;
therefore, there could only be seven
planets and seven metals. Because there were
seventy-two disciples and seventy-two interpreters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
of the old testament and seventy-two
mystical names of God; therefore there must
be no more and no less than seventy-two joints
in the human body.</p>

<p>During this period, European cities had no
paving or lighting, and one could not step
from a doorway in London or Paris without
plunging ankle deep in mud. They had practically
no drainage and they were, at frequent
intervals devastated by the plague. But the
cities of Andalusia, built and governed by the
Moors in Spain, were drained, well lighted and
solidly paved. They had public libraries and
public schools. From their medical colleges
Europe obtained the only doctors it had.</p>

<p>In the cities of Christian Europe these enlightened
people were treated like dogs, while
in their wonderful cities, visiting Christians
were met with a hospitality and broad toleration
wholly exceptional in the middle ages.</p>

<p>In Europe, even toward the close of this
period, broad, scientific thinking was impossible.
Nicholas Copernicus, in the 16th
century, afraid of the faggot, carried as a
secret locked in his own bosom, that heliocentric
theory which is the foundation of
modern astronomy. His great disciple Giordano
Bruno, for expounding that theory with
rare ability, after it was revealed by the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Prussian, was hunted through Europe like a
wild animal and finally burned at the stake.</p>

<p>For the same reason, the third person in the
trinity of the 16th century’s greatest thinkers,
Galileo, was harassed and humiliated, and at
last died a prisoner in his own house.</p>

<p>But all through this period, despite its intellectual
stagnation, economic evolution proceeded,
laying the foundation for a new intellectual
superstructure. That evolution
manifested itself chiefly in the rise and growth
of a trading class. To the existence of such a
class in its society, the Arabians owed their
greater liberality, and scientific spirit. When
Vasca Da Gama sailed down the west coast of
Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope
into the Indian Ocean, trusting to chance for
the outcome of his voyage, he found the
Arabians directing their vessels by a strange
instrument which we now call the mariner’s
compass.</p>

<p>The merchants of Genoa and of Spain discovered
that orthodox superstitions did not
help but did seriously injure, their commerce.
As captains for their ships they preferred for
purely economic reasons, men who had become
infected with the ideas of navigation of the
pagan Arabians, to men who took their ideas
of the universe from the city bishop or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
village priest and kept their ships close to
land, afraid lest they should sail off the edge
of the world, or into that great hole where the
angels put the sun at night, after they had
finished rolling it across the sky.</p>

<p>It was the growth and final triumph of this
trading class, with economic interests and a
mode of wealth production that demanded the
liberation of science, that abolished the thumbscrew
and the stake. Voltaire, Rousseau, and
the encyclopaedists were obnoxious to the
feudal regime, lay and clerical, because they
were the prophets and mouthpieces of the
rising bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>This class, by the emancipation of science,
performed a lasting service to the human race.
The society in which it predominated, at once
produced a prolific crop of great thinkers.
Sweden had Linnaeus, England had Lyell,
Germany had Goethe; but the palm fell to
France. In the revolution France had suppressed
the Sorbonne, that theological institution
which had always shown itself the official
and bitter enemy of science, and she soon after
equipped scientific expeditions, which gave her
the greatest thinkers of that day—Cuvier, St.
Hilaire, and, most illustrious of all that courageous
pioneer of modern evolution, Jean Lamarck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
The position of the capitalist class of a
hundred years ago was very different from
that of today. Then it was the harbinger of
progress; now it is the stronghold of reaction.
Its interests then were very different from its
interests now. Then it was called upon by
destiny to steer society into new waters; now
destiny bids it, since its task is done, to step
aside that a new hand may grip the wheel.
Then it fought a social order which had had
its day, now it is in the midst of social forces
which it cannot administer. That was its
lusty youth; this is its doddering old age.</p>

<p>When the Bourgeoisie released science from
feudal chains, it let loose a force that carried it
to victory, but, at that moment, it planted the
germs of its own future destruction. Today it
reverses its attitude and would fain suppress
science or at least prevent its reaching the
proletarian brain. But alas, it is in the grip of
evolutionary processes of which it is merely
a part, and it is bound, more securely than
Prometheus to the rock, to a mode of production
which makes the education of the
proletariat a relentless necessity. The nation
which keeps its working class in semi-feudal
darkness is ground to pieces by the industrial
competition of its neighbors—it goes to the
wall in the struggle for existence. Thus, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the language of Marx, it is obliged by present
necessity to dig its own future grave.</p>

<p>The same inscrutable power that called it
forth to lead society to a new triumph, now
relegates it to the rear and enthrones in its
place a new class, a propertyless working
class, the child of the wage system, destined
to emancipate itself and, by the same stroke,
the whole human race. If this be not the mission
of the working class, as an instrument of
social evolution, the press and platform of the
Socialist movement is a useless dissipation of
energy. But this is precisely what Marx
proved when he laid the foundation of the
Socialist philosophy.</p>

<p>Every year brings its quota of evidence that
the working class is gathering the political
capacity and the social intelligence necessary
to equip it for this tremendous task.</p>

<p>Norway grew weary of Swedish dominance
and decided to achieve national independence.
At once the Swedish Bourgeoisie began to gird
up its loins for a bloody dynastic war. The
pampered sons of its aristocracy, unable to do
anything useful, were to have glory thrust
upon them, commanding, from the rear,
regiments of Swedish workers to slaughter
and be slaughtered by their exploited Norwegian
brothers. But while these sinister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
preparations were in full blast, a vast army
of Norwegians crossed the boundary line
into Sweden and met a Swedish army of
the same proportions. There was no blood-shedding
for both armies were unarmed. In
place of bayonets and needle guns they had
their wives and children. They fraternized;
they clasped hands; they tossed each other’s
babies in their arms. From that moment war
was impossible. They carried neither the
national banner of Sweden nor of Norway.
Over both those great armies, now become
one, singing their songs of working class
solidarity, there floated the red flag of the
social revolution.</p>

<span class="subhead">LINNAEUS TO LAMARCK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a hundred years the word “progress” has
been a word to conjure with. No proposal is
too reactionary to be put forward in its name
and the self-admitted conservative explains
that he only wishes to “conserve” the good
things which progress has bestowed upon us.
It has been invoked on all sides of all
questions, and no superstition was so ancient
or absurd, no theory so exploded, but it could
be revived under a new name and presented to
the world as an infallible sign of the progress
of the age.</p>

<p>But during the last century men have arisen,
who were dissatisfied with a term that covered
everything and meant nothing, and who were
determined to find out what constituted progress
and whether it had any existence in the
world of reality. More has been accomplished
in this respect during that century than in all
the combined previous existence of the human
race. The conception or idea of progress is the
mental reflection of the process of evolution,
which operates everywhere to the remotest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
niche or cranny in the material universe. The
only difference between progress and evolution
is that evolution is a more inclusive term,
including as it does phenomena which we
should call retrogressive.</p>

<p>The men who laid the foundations of
modern knowledge, and imparted sense and
force to hitherto meaningless terms, were they
who threw aside theological phantasms and
metaphysical speculations and set themselves
the task of gathering the facts and ascertaining
the laws of the real—the material—world.
This is the method of science, and it is to this
method that we owe all our knowledge of
world problems.</p>

<p>For more than a thousand years this method
was practically suspended. Any attempt, during
that period, to make use of it was rigorously
suppressed, except among the pagan
Arabians. Biological science stood still,
scarcely even marking time. Says Packard
“After Aristotle, no epoch-making zoologist
arose until Linnaeus was born,” a yawning
chasm of thirteen hundred years.</p>

<p>Linnaeus, born 1707, in Sweden, was the
greatest naturalist of his time and might have
done greater things for evolutionary ideas had
it not been for the theological influences which
restrained him. But, hindered as he was, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
accomplished enough to entitle him to a place
among the immortals. “He found botany a
chaos,” says Prof. Thatcher, “and left it a
unity.” His contribution to science consists
mainly in his system of classification and
nomenclature. Before Linnaeus nobody had
been able, though many had tried, to group
and name animal and vegetable forms in such
a manner as to rescue them from utter confusion.
This is precisely what Linnaeus did
when, by a happy idea, he adopted what is
called the “binary nomenclature.”</p>

<p>This great advance was by no means far-fetched;
it is simply an application of the
double naming everywhere in use, as in the
case of Tom Smith, Fred Smith, James Smith,
in which Smith is used to denote the general
or family name and Fred or Tom the particular
or personal. In the application of this system
to species, Linnaeus reversed the order as we
do when we enter the names of persons on an
alphabetical list, as Smith, Fred and Smith,
James. As illustrations we will take the two
cases, one from the animal and one from the
plant world, selected by Haeckel for the same
purpose. The generic name for cat is Felis.
The common cat is Felis domestica; the wildcat,
Felis catus; the panther, Felis pardus; the
jaguar, Felis onca; the tiger, Felis tigris; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
lion, Felis leo. All these second names are the
names of the six species of the one genus—Felis.
As an example in botany take the genus
pine. According to Linnaeus the pine is Pinus
abies; the fir, Pinus picea; the larch, Pinus
larix; the Italian pine, Pinus pinea; the Siberian
stone pine Pinus cembra; the knee
timber, Pinus mughus; the common pine,
Pinus silvestris. The seven second names apply
to the seven species of the genus Pinus.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Besides grouping the
species into genera, Linnaeus classified certain
genera as belonging to the same “order.”
Again he arranged these “orders” in “classes,”
all these classes belonged to one of the two
great “kingdoms,” vegetable and animal.</p>

<p>Not only was all this of great practical value
but its theoretical influence has been incalculable.
Linnaeus never saw, and probably
would not have dared to proclaim if he had,
that the resemblances which made his grouping
possible, indicated a relationship based on
descent from common ancestors. This was
left for men of greater penetration and courage
living in a less theological age. Prelates who
smiled on the obscene debaucheries of Louis
the XV. had Linnaeus’ writings prohibited
from papal states, because they proved the
existence of sex in plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
Linnaeus not only proved sex in plants but
made it the foundation of his classification. He
also reminds us that plants were known to be
of both sexes by oriental people in early days.
Living as they did on the fruit of the date-palms
they found it necessary to plant male
trees among the females. Their enemies in
war time struck a terrible blow when they cut
down the male trees, thereby reducing them to
famine. Sometimes the inhabitants themselves
destroyed the male trees during impending invasion,
so that the enemy should find no
sustenance in their country; a war measure
similar to that of Russians who burned
Moscow in the face of Napoleon.</p>

<p>In the same year that Sweden produced Linnaeus,
France gave birth to Buffon. Rich and
independent, he chose to devote a long life to
the study of natural history. He had remarkable
powers of research and displayed genius
in presenting the results of his investigation.
But alas! he had less courage than Linnaeus
and he lived nearer that terrible enemy of
eighteenth century science, the theological department
of the University of Paris—the
dreaded Sorbonne.</p>

<p>As long as he confined himself to the mere
description of animals he was a pet of the
church, which seems to have pleased him, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
when he began to draw evolutionary conclusions
of real philosophical import and value,
the Sorbonne at once opened its batteries. On
these occasions Buffon’s retreat was prompt
and unprotesting. It might be remembered as
some mitigation of his cowardice that while
the reign of the stake and faggot did not
extend into the 18th century and there was no
danger of the fate of the fearless Bruno, yet
so strong was religious bigotry even in this
period that Rousseau was hunted out of
France, his books burned by the public executioner,
and Diderot went to jail. “Hardly a
single man of letters of that time escaped
arbitrary imprisonment,” says John Morley in
his “Rousseau.”</p>

<p>This was all very repugnant to the pride and
vanity of Buffon and led him to adopt a style
of writing much in vogue a century earlier
when the theological hand was heavy as death.
This method was to put forward the new idea
as a heresy or a mere fancy, explain it, and
then proceed with great show of earnestness to
demolish it in favor of the orthodox view. This
method succeeded admirably until it broke
through the thick skulls of religious bigots
that the case presented for the “heresy” was
more convincing than the pretended reply.</p>

<p>A fine example of this appears in the fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
volume of Buffon’s “Natural History.” “If
we once admit” says he, “that the ass belongs
to the horse family, and that it only differs
from it because it has been modified, we may
likewise say that the monkey is of the same
family as man, that it is a modified man, that
man and the monkey have had a common
origin like the horse and ass, that each family
has had but a single source, and even that all
the animals have come from a single animal,
which in the succession of ages has produced,
while perfecting and modifying itself, all the
races of other animals.... If it were
known that in the animals there had been, I
do not say several species, but a single one
which had been produced by modification from
another species; if it were true that the ass is
only a modified horse, there would be no limit
to the power of nature, and we would not be
wrong in supposing that from a single being
she has known how to derive, with time, all
the other organized beings.”</p>

<p>There is no such clear statement of the
evolutionary theory in the “System of Nature”
of Linnaeus, and if Buffon had proclaimed
these views as his own and courageously defended
them, he would have made his name
the greatest of the 18th century, and clothed
himself with immortality. But the stuff of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
martyrs did not enter into his composition, and
the very next passage to the one above, translated
reads—“But no! It is certain from revelation
that all animals have alike been favored
with the grace of an act of direct creation, and
that the first pair of every species issued fully
formed from the hands of the creator.”</p>

<p>When the Sorbonne thought it was being
fooled it compelled Buffon to recant publicly
and have his recantation printed. In that recantation
he announced, “I abandon everything
in my book respecting the formation of
the earth and generally all which may be
contrary to the narrative of Moses.”</p>

<p>The impression we get from reading Buffon,
is that he did not realize the importance of
those great evolutionary ideas which he stated
so well and repudiated as regularly. Had he
done so and stood by them, he would have
been the Darwin of his day, but he would in
all likelihood have spent the latter part of his
life in the Bastile.</p>

<p>Not until forty years later do we meet the
real and valiant precursor of Darwin, albeit a
countryman of Buffon’s, but with a more
profoundly philosophical mind and without his
fear. This was Jean Baptiste Lamarck, born
at Bazentin, France, 1744, and educated at the
college of the Jesuits at Amiens. He served in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the seven years war and then occupied himself
studying medicine and science at Paris. He
died, poor and blind, in 1829.</p>

<p>Lamarck boldly proclaimed his unshakable
faith in the doctrine of the transformation of
species, and defended it against the strong tide
of popular disfavor and the overwhelming
opposition provoked by the antagonism of the
great zoologist Cuvier. Cuvier’s opposition
would have crushed a weaker man but Lamarck
bore bravely up and calmly left his case
for the future to decide. Cuvier held species
to be constant, as was consonant with current
and orthodox ideas. This made him a social
favorite and the pet of the church, and honors
were showered profusely upon him to the end
of his days. Not so Lamarck; although born
25 years earlier, his theories were half a
century in advance of Cuvier’s, and he paid the
penalty that has so often overtaken those
pioneers whose vision anticipated the future.</p>

<p>“Attacked on all sides,” says his friend and
colleague, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, “injured likewise
by odious ridicule, Lamarck, too indignant
to answer these cutting epigrams, submitted
to the indignity with a sorrowful
patience.... Lamarck lived a long while
poor, blind, and forsaken, but not by me; I
shall ever love and venerate him.” Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
writer of that period exclaims, “Lamarck, thy
abandonment, sad as it was in thy old age, is
better than the ephemeral glory of men who
maintain their reputation by sharing in the
errors of their time.” As to Cuvier, the one
stain on his career is his unworthy attitude toward
his celebrated opponent and fellow
worker. Lamarck had, with his usual generosity,
aided and favored him when he first came
to the Museum of Natural History at Paris,
allowing him to hold, in addition to his own
chair, which was in Vertebrate Zoology, the
chair of Molluscs, which was in Lamarck’s
special field, where he had no equal, and which
was properly his. But Lamarck opposed, with
great politeness and without mentioning his
name the attempt made by Cuvier to harmonize
science with the orthodox theology of his
day by means of that theory of “cataclysms”
which in spite of its being strenuously defended
by so recent a thinker as Agassiz, has
been relegated to the limbo of exploded theories.</p>

<p>When Lamarck died, Cuvier as his most
notable contemporary was called upon to pronounce
his eulogy. What a miserable and unworthy
performance it was! Even after death,
religious antipathy—that ever-flowing fountain
of meanness—survived in Cuvier’s breast, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
De Blainville records that “the Academy did
not even allow it to be printed in the form in
which it was pronounced,” and it is said that
portions of it had to be omitted as unfit for
publication. Haeckel, speaking of Lamarck’s
great book, “Zoological Philosophy,” complains
that “Cuvier, Lamarck’s greatest opponent,
in his ‘Report on the Progress of
Natural Science,’ in which the most unimportant
anatomical investigations are enumerated,
does not devote a single word to this
work, which forms an epoch in science.”</p>

<p>But history has reversed the scales and
posterity has repaired the wrong. That theory
of biological evolution, which was despised
and rejected by the builders of his day has
become the corner-stone of modern knowledge,
while Cuvier’s fantastic “Theory of the Earth”
has gone to the museum of curiosities.</p>

<p>Lamarck’s immortality is secured by his
assertion and defense of the theory of descent,
alone. This theory is, that all existing species
have descended from ancestors who were in a
vast number of cases, and ultimately in all,
very different from their present representatives;
that this difference is due, not to the
total extinction of the previous species by
“cataclysms,” and the divine creation of new
ones, as Cuvier maintained, but because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
previous species changed in adapting themselves
to a changed environment.</p>

<p>But Lamarck has another claim to a niche
in the Pantheon of Science. As the conviction
gained ground that species were not fixed and
immutable as they came from the hands of an
alleged creator, but were the products of an
evolutionary development extending through
immense periods of time, another question
arose and called for an answer. That question
was—“By what process?”</p>

<p>Charles Darwin is the most illustrious of all
the sons of science because he answered that
question. Lamarck gave an answer, and the
question as to whether that answer is entitled
to be incorporated in the answer of Darwin,
as a supplementary amendment is sometimes
made a part of the motion, still divides the
biological world into two camps. But in that
controversy between the Weismannians and
the Neo-Lamarckians, aptly called “The Battle
of the Darwinians,” no matter what becomes
of the Lamarckian factor, all are agreed that
the “Natural Selection” of Darwin is impregnable.</p>

<p>Lamarck’s theory may be summed up as
<span class="locked">follows—</span></p>

<p>(1.) Every change in the environment of
animals creates for them new needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
(2.) These new needs will compel these
animals to adopt new habits and discard some
old ones, and these needs and habits will produce
and develop new organs.</p>

<p>(3.) The development or disappearance of
organs depends on their use or disuse.</p>

<p>(4.) The effects of use or disuse, acquired
by animals, are transmitted by heredity to
their offspring.</p>

<p>This fourth factor has split the biological
world since Weismann repudiated it in 1883.</p>

<p>As a typical case of the operation of his
theory, Lamarck gives the following: “The
serpents having taken up the habit of gliding
along the ground, and of concealing themselves
in the grass, their body, owing to continually
repeated efforts to elongate itself so
as to pass through narrow spaces, has acquired
a considerable length disproportionate to its
size. Moreover limbs would have been very
useless to these animals, and consequently
would not have been employed because long
legs would have interfered with their need of
gliding, and very short legs, not being more
than four in number, would have been incapable
of moving their body. Hence the lack
of use of these parts having been constant in
the races of these animals, has caused the
total disappearance of these same parts, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
really included in the plan of organization
of animals of their class.”</p>

<p>The idea of the serpent getting its long
body, or the giraffe its long neck, or shore
birds their long legs by “stretching,” has
brought a good deal of ridicule upon Lamarck’s
theory, and that part of it has never been taken
very seriously.</p>

<p>This mistake however, will no more affect
Lamarck’s title to a place among the immortals,
than will the equally unfortunate
theory of “pangenesis” endanger the status of
his still greater successor—Darwin.</p>

<p>Lamarck’s glory is that he boldly proclaimed
and largely proved the general theory of descent—biological
evolution.</p>

<span class="subhead">DARWIN’S NATURAL SELECTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the year 1906, the paper which has the
largest circulation among English Socialists,
“The Clarion,” took a vote of its readers as to
whom they considered to be the greatest man,
the man who had contributed most to the
progress of the race, which England had produced.
By an overwhelming majority the
place of honor went to Charles Darwin. That
vote was as much a vindication of English
Socialists as it was of the man whose name
has become almost a synonym for “modern
science.”</p>

<p>Liebknecht, in his “Biographical Memoirs
of Karl Marx”, speaking of Marx and himself,
says: ”When Darwin drew the consequences
of his investigations and presented them to
the public, we spoke for months of nothing else
but Darwin and the revolutionizing power of
his scientific conquests.”</p>

<p>Leopold Jacoby writes thus: “The same
year in which appeared Darwin’s book (1859)
and coming from a quite different direction, an
identical impulse was given to a very important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
development of social science by a
work which long passed unnoticed, and which
bore the title: “Critique of Political Economy”
by Karl Marx—it was the forerunner of
Capital. What Darwin’s book on the “Origin
of Species” is on the subject of the genesis and
evolution of organic life from non-sentient
nature up to Man, the work of Marx is on the
subject of the genesis and evolution of association
among human beings, of States, and the
social forms of humanity.”</p>

<p>Commenting on this passage of Jacoby’s
Enrico Ferri says: “And this is why Germany,
which has been the most fruitful field for the
development of the Darwinian theories, is
also the most fruitful field for the intelligent,
systematic propaganda of socialist ideas. And
it is precisely for this reason that in Berlin,
in the windows of the book-stores of the socialist
propaganda, the works of Charles Darwin
occupy the place of honor beside those of
Karl Marx.”</p>

<p>Frederick Engels, in his reply to Duehring,
speaks of Darwin as follows: “He dealt the
metaphysical conception of nature the heaviest
blow by his proof that all organic beings,
plants, animals, and man himself, are the
products of a process of evolution going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
through millions of years. In this connection
Darwin must be named before all others.”</p>

<p>Again, in the preface to the “Communist
Manifesto” speaking of the materialistic conception
of history, he says: “This proposition,
in my opinion, is destined to do for history
what Darwin’s theory has done for biology.”</p>

<p>And speaking at the grave-side of his
illustrious colleague—Marx, he said: “Just as
Darwin discovered the law of development in
organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of
development in human society.”</p>

<p>Says August Bebel, in “Woman,” “Marx,
Darwin, Buckle, have all three, each in his
own way, been of the greatest significance for
modern development and the future form and
growth of human society will, to an extreme
degree, be shaped and guided by their teaching
and discoveries.”</p>

<p>And Kautsky in his work on ethics declares
that Darwin’s discoveries “belong to the
greatest and most fruitful of the human intellect,
and enable us to develop a new critique
of knowledge.”</p>

<p>Ernest Untermann, in his latest work “Marxian
Economics,” well says: “Marx discovered
the specific laws of social development among
human beings. * * * But while doing this, it
never occurred to him to disregard the results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
of Darwin’s work. On the contrary, he knew
the art of combining Darwin’s results with his
own, without doing violence to either.”</p>

<p>This evidence of the general consensus of
opinion among Socialist scholars as to the
value of Darwin’s work and its special importance
for Socialism could easily be enlarged
indefinitely. But enough has been cited to
show that a comprehensive grasp of the Socialist
philosophy implies a knowledge of
Darwinian theories.</p>

<p>The greatness of Darwin’s work has two
aspects; the immense impetus he gave to the
general theory of evolution, and, his discovery
of its main process, “natural selection.” In
the popular mind this distinction is lost in
confusion and a great army of popular but
ill-informed expounders have added to the
muddle. The two things although closely related—cause
and effect—are yet quite
distinct, and a clearer understanding of Darwin’s
work is made possible by the distinction
being kept in mind. The honor of having discovered
“natural selection” Darwin shares
with Wallace only; as a contributor to the
theory of evolution, he is one of a long and
illustrious line. But even here he is the greatest
of them all precisely because of his specific discovery
which, by explaining how evolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
works—at least among living things,
(biology)—has made the general theory impregnable.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to that specific theory let
us clearly understand that evolution has
ceased to be a theory merely, it is also a well
established fact. Anyone who denies this has
no part or lot in the intellectual life of the last
half century. Such a one, as Professor
Giddings recently said, “inhabits a world of
intellectual shades. He cannot grasp the
earthly interests of the twentieth century.”</p>

<p>Every science in the biological hierarchy has
contributed its quota to the establishment of
the theory of evolution, and that theory in
return has, in one department after another,
produced order and system where before
nothing existed but a conglomerate mass of
apparently unrelated facts. So thoroughly
has the theory impregnated every branch of
science that an intelligent dentist must be an
evolutionist.</p>

<p>The chief honors fall to the two sciences
Ontogeny and Phylogeny. Ontogeny deals
with the history of the germ from its beginning
as an egg to its full fruition as a fully
developed individual or as Haeckel defines it,
“the history of the evolution of individual
human organisms.” Phylogeny is defined by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the same authority as, “the history of the evolution
of the descent of man, that is, of the
evolution of the various animal forms through
which, in the course of countless ages, mankind
has gradually passed to its present form.”</p>

<p>I mention these two sciences together because
it is by comparing them that their chief
significance appears. It is one of the most
astonishing discoveries of science and at the
same time one of the most convincing proofs
of evolution, that the whole process of the
development of the human race from the
lowest or simplest forms, which constitutes the
subject-matter of phylogeny, is reproduced in
brief in the development of the embryo of the
individual. This remarkable fact Haeckel
named “the biogenetic principle.”</p>

<p>Darwin’s chief claim however to a pedestal
in the hall of fame rests on his discovery of
“natural selection.”</p>

<p>During his memorable voyage on “The
Beagle” he observed that there was no
essential connection between a species’ reproductive
powers and the number of its population.
As this discovery plays an important
part in his theory we will let him speak for
himself. In his “Journal of Researches” he
gives the following case, with his conclusion:
“I was surprised to find, on counting the eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
of a large white Doris (a kind of sea slug)
how extraordinarily numerous they were.
From two to five eggs (each three thousandths
of an inch in diameter) were contained in a
spherical little case. These were arranged two
deep in transverse rows forming a ribbon. The
ribbon adhered to the rock in an oval sphere.
One which I found, measured nearly twenty
inches in length and half inch in breadth. By
counting how many balls were contained in
a tenth of an inch in the row, and how many
rows in an equal length of the ribbon, on the
most moderate computation there were six
hundred thousand eggs. Yet this Doris was
certainly not very common: although I was
often searching under the stones I saw only
seven individuals. No fallacy is more common
among naturalists, than that the numbers of
an individual species depend on its powers of
propagation.”</p>

<p>This instance is moderate compared with
multitudes of others. The question then arises
as to why, of such a numerous progeny, only
a sufficient number reach adult stage as will
replace the parent stock so that population
remains practically stationary.</p>

<p>Here Darwin became indebted to Dr.
Malthus who, but for that indebtedness would
have been forgotten ere this. In his “Essay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
on Population” Malthus points out various
“checks” to the increase of population. His
main theory was that the population tends to
increase more rapidly than the food supply.
The Reverend Doctor, having begotten twelve
children of his own, felt “called” to point out
to British parents the desirability and even
necessity of limiting their families in the
interest of society. Malthus applied his
theory to human society where it is palpably
false. Darwin transferred it to the natural
world where it proved to be a great truth.
The obvious explanation of this paradox is:
that man, by agriculture and industry, can
increase his food supply to a greater proportion
than any probable or even possible increase of
population. Animals cannot; their food supply
is beyond their control; they have no power to
artificially increase the supply. This difference
totally destroyed the value of Malthus’ book
as a treatise on political economy. His immortality
is assured solely because he accidentally
contributed a link to Darwin’s
chain.</p>

<p>And now Darwin has travelled on his great
journey thus far: Animals propagate enormously
but their population generally does not
increase. The main reason for this, though
there are others, is, that their number is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
limited by the amount of food available.
Therefore, if two parents produce ten thousand
only two or three individuals will reach
maturity: the rest will perish. The remainder
of the problem, which still remained for Darwin
to solve, was: first, is there any law which
determines which shall survive and which shall
be destroyed; and second, if there is such a
law, will that law explain and thus, at the
same time, prove, the origin of new species?
It is precisely because Darwin solved both
points of this tremendous problem with a
clear and irrefutable affirmative that he occupies
the foremost place in the annals of science.</p>

<p>Professor John Fiske said: “There is one
thing which a man of original scientific or
philosophical genius in a rightly ordered world
should never be called upon to do. He should
never be called upon to earn a living; for that
is a wretched waste of energy, in which the
highest intellectual power is sure to suffer
serious detriment, and runs the risk of being
frittered away into hopeless ruin.”</p>

<p>Whether Fiske was right or wrong the only
pertinent point here is that Darwin was
spared that necessity.</p>

<p>To his great task he brought a patience that
is almost without parallel. One of his biographers,
Grant Allen, tells us that: “His uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
and father-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood, suggested
to him that the apparent sinking of
stones on the surface might really be due to
earthworm castings. So, as soon as he had
some land of his own to experiment upon, he
began in 1842, to spread broken chalk over a
field at Down, in which, twenty-nine years
later in 1871, a trench was dug to test the
results. “What other naturalist,” asks Allen,
ever waited so long and so patiently to discover
the upshot of a single experiment? Is
it wonderful that a man who worked like that
should succeed, not by faith but by logical
power, in removing mountains?”</p>

<p>Darwin studied domestic animals. He observed
how many, and how widely different,
races there are of horses, dogs, swine, poultry
in general and pigeons in particular. In each
instance the many varieties are derived from
an original common stock, as domestic fowls
from the Indian jungle fowl, and pigeons from
the old-world rock-dove.</p>

<p>“Derived,” but how—by what process? In
the case of domestic creatures this was not
difficult to answer. It is accomplished by
breeders “selecting” the individuals to be bred
from. In the case of pigeons, which Darwin
laid particular stress on the fancier seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
be able to obtain almost any kind of a bird by
selecting as parents those pigeons which had
the desired characteristics developed to the
most pronounced degree, and then again selecting
in the same way from their progeny.
In this way were produced birds so different
from each other and their ancestors as the
tumbler, the fantail, the pouter, and about a
hundred and fifty other varieties. The same
with horses. If the breeder desired draught
horses, he selected for parents those
animals with massive shoulders and sturdy
limbs. When a racer wins a “classic” race, it
is at once sent to the stud-farm. Although in
the zenith of its powers it races no more; it
is “selected” for another and more important
role—the reproduction and, it is hoped, the
accentuation of the characteristics which
enabled it to outrun its competitors.</p>

<p>All this impressed on Darwin’s mind the
importance of the word “selection,” which
appears in the title of his theory and the subtitle
of his epoch-making book. Could it be
possible that nature contained some principle
or combination of principles, which performed
among wild animals a part analogous to that
of the breeder, among domestic animals?
Darwin discovered that this is precisely what
takes place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
His famous theory may be formulated under
the three following heads:</p>

<blockquote class="nojustify">

<p class="hang">(1) Heredity.</p>

<p class="hang">(2) Variation.</p>

<p class="hang">(3) The struggle for existence, with its
resultant, survival of the fittest.</p></blockquote>

<p>Darwin requires very little of heredity, and
what he does ask is beyond dispute. It is
enough for his theory if like begets like and
“figs do not grow on thistles.”</p>

<p>Similarly with variation, the demands of his
hypothesis are very slight. If it be conceded
that variation is a fact, that offspring do vary
from their parents and each other, it is
enough. And who will dispute this in a world
where no two creatures are exactly and in all
particulars alike? The apparent contradiction
that, heredity demands likeness, while variation
requires difference, is confined to the surface—it
is not real. The likeness is general
while the difference is particular. A sheep may
be born with shorter or longer legs, by variation;
but it will be a sheep and not a horse,
by heredity.</p>

<p>As an example of the working of the theory
let us take Lamarck’s piece de resistance, the
giraffe. Lamarck says: “We know that this
animal, the tallest of mammals, inhabits the
interior of Africa, and that it lives in localities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
where the earth, almost always arid and
destitute of herbage, obliges it to browse on
the foliage of trees and to make continual
efforts to reach it. It has resulted from this
habit, maintained for a long period in all the
individuals of its race, that its forelegs have
become longer than the hinder ones, and that
its neck is so elongated that the giraffe, without
standing on its hind legs, raises its head
and reaches six meters in height (almost
twenty feet).”</p>

<p>Lamarck thought this length of neck was
acquired by “continual efforts to reach,” or,
as Alfred Russell Wallace puts it in his criticism
of Lamarck—“stretching.” Many critics
ventilated their wit on this theory of Lamarck’s,
under the impression that they were
lampooning Darwin’s idea.</p>

<p>They made a blunder similar to that of those
critics of Utopian Socialism who labor under
the pleasing delusion that they are riddling
the theories of Marx. Professor Ritchie has
preserved a couple of stanzas by a witty
Scotch judge who aimed his poem at Darwin,
but hit Lamarck.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A deer with a neck that was longer by half<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the rest of his family, try not to laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By stretching and stretching became a giraffe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which nobody can deny.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That four-footed beast which we now call a whale,<br /></span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
<span class="i0">Held his hind-legs so close that they grew to a tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he uses for threshing the sea, like a flail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which nobody can deny.”</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But Darwin’s theory is altogether independent
of the “stretching” idea. The causes
and origin of heredity and variation are up to
this moment, alike wrapped in mystery. But
when science succeeds in penetrating those
secrets, it is extremely unlikely that Darwin’s
theory will be seriously weakened, no matter
what the causes may prove to be.</p>

<p>Now about the giraffe. We will suppose,
for the sake of illustration, two giraffes, a
male and a female, whose necks are precisely
five feet long. We will confine our illustration
to the question of the neck alone. We will
suppose this particular pair to give birth to a
family of three. First comes heredity. All we
ask of heredity is that the young shall be
giraffes, not camels or any other species; and
this heredity guarantees. Now comes variation.
As this is an ideal case for the purpose
of illustrating the theory, we will have one of
the three shorter-necked than the parents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
another the same length, while the third has a
longer neck—over five feet.</p>

<p>Now comes the struggle for existence. When
this family of giraffes is fairly grown and the
new-comers are approaching breeding age—mark
the importance of this matter of
“breeding age,” for the problem is to find out
how nature determines which shall be bred
from—they are obliged to forage for themselves.
There is no pasture to graze; they
live in what is almost a desert. There are few
shrubs; scarcely anything but fairly high
trees—from ten to twenty feet. If a giraffe
breeder had this matter in hand and he wished
to increase the length of the giraffe’s neck, the
problem would be simple. He would select
number three with the longest neck, pair it
with the longest necked member of the opposite
sex in some other family and the trick
would be done. But this is in Central Africa,
where there is no breeder to interfere, and the
question is: can nature accomplish the same
result without his help?</p>

<p>This is what happens. First the leaves are
eaten from all the lower branches as they are
reached with the least effort. Then they go
higher and still higher until the point is
reached where number one with the shortest
neck cannot reach any further and the terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
struggle for existence begins. Number two sees
no danger as yet and number three has things
all his own way. But with short-necked number
one, a tragedy has begun. Every day now
sees the food further out of his reach and even
number two is obliged to reach out for his
supply. The breeding time is approaching but
the longer necked and therefore well-fed and
vigourous females will have nothing to do with
this wobbley starving creature, and the longer
necked, well-fed males shun the short-necked
starving females. If the starving ones mate,
the mother dies before giving birth to offspring,
or she cannot get nourishment enough
to rear her progeny; in either case there is no
effective succession. So the longer-necked
are the fittest and they survive. Thus does
nature “select” one by the negative process of
destroying the rest, in about the same way as
a man “selects” one puppy in a litter by
drowning the rest.</p>

<p>In the case of the puppies we may say
“artificial selection;” in the case of the giraffe
it is “natural selection.” And this theory,
simple as it may seem here, revolutionized
Biology.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that “natural” selection
has many advantages over “artificial”
selection. The breeder may be mistaken;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
he may select the wrong puppy and drown
its superior. The horse that won the
great race may have had a fleeter-footed companion
in the same stable had the trainer
known how to develop his possibilities. The
gardener may have passed the best root or
stem through carelessness. But nature makes
no such mistakes, or if she does she eventually
redeems them. Her method, while it is wholly
fortuitous and unintelligent, is practically infallible.
The condition of survival is, adaptation
to environment. The very process of
selection is, in itself, a sure test of fitness.
True, moral considerations are eliminated—at
least in the non-social world—yet nature offers
something like a fair field and no favors. When
we speak of nature’s favorites, we simply mean
those who are best fitted to meet her hard
conditions.</p>

<p>Take a row of celery plants, from which
future seedlings are to be “selected.”</p>

<p>In this instance, let us suppose, the quality
desired is ability to resist frost. How is the
gardener to know which of fifty plants are the
“best” in this respect. He has no method of
finding out with any degree of certainty. But
nature comes along some night with a sharp
frost and “selects” ten by killing forty. And
the very act of this “natural” selection proves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
that these ten are better able to withstand the
frost than their fellows.</p>

<p>Breeders of white sheep who supply the
white wool market have a very tangible guide—they
kill every lamb that shows the least
tinge of black. But even here, nature is not
to be out-done. In Virginia there is—or at
least was in Darwin’s day—a wild hog of pure
black. One of its staple foods was known as
the “paint-root.” Any hog with the least
speck of white on its body was poisoned by
this root while its all-black brothers found it
a health-sustaining and succulent food.</p>

<p>In an environment which remained constant
and where a species of animals had reached a
population which strained the limits of subsistence—food
supply—those offspring which
most closely resemble their parents, who had
won out in that environment, would again
succeed and be selected. While if the environment
changed—became warmer or colder
for example—those descendants which happened
to vary in a direction making them
better able to cope with the new conditions
would be selected for survival as against those
who resembled their parents, which parents
had survived in their day because they were
adapted to the prior environment.</p>

<p>For example, a country is well supplied with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
water and it is as a consequence fertile and
“green.” In such a country green insects and
green reptiles will be selected, because a green
background will render them almost invisible
to their enemies. Individuals of other colors
will make their appearance by variation, but
they will be such plain targets to their enemies,
they will be devoured before they reach
breeding age and have a chance to reproduce
the variation.</p>

<p>But suppose desiccation (drying up) sets
in. The country loses its water supply, as
Krapotkin has shown to have been the case in
North-West Mongolia and East Turkestan,
leading to the enforced exodus of the barbarians.
Now green will disappear and brown or
yellow—say brown—takes its place. While this
change will not, so far as we know, cause insects
and lizards to breed brown instead of
green, it will ensure the survival or “selection”
of such as are born brown and the destruction
of those who breed true to their green ancestors.
Now every atavistic return to green will be
mercilessly weeded out, just as, when the country
was well-watered and green, every sporadic
production of brown was done to death.</p>

<p>This is the biological foundation of that
environment philosophy which now pervades
all our thinking. Change the physical environment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
says the biologist, and the species will
be transformed. Change the economic environment,
says the Socialist, and, if you make
the right change, the race will be redeemed.
Both statements rest on the same fundamental
laws.</p>

<p>As the many and highly important implications
of this theory, are fully dealt with in
subsequent lectures most of them will be
passed here.</p>

<p>We may note however, that whenever any
nation in the modern world, produces, in the
development of its industry, a Socialistic
variation, that new feature at once proves its
utility and is “selected” in the Darwinian
sense, because it constitutes an advantage over
the previous form of social organization, in
that particular. This is the reason why the
trust—which is socialistic and revolutionary
in its essential tendences—is always victorious,
in spite of the foolish ravings of the Hearst
newspapers and the antediluvian twaddle of
William Jennings Bryan.</p>

<p>But Darwin’s crowning achievement is that
he made the general theory of evolution impregnable
by thoroughly and conclusively
demonstrating it in his own field as a naturalist.
From then on it was only a question of time
as to when its application would be universal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
Socialism may be defined as the application
of the theory of evolution to the phenomena of
society. This is precisely what Marx and
Engels accomplished, and this why their work
is so fundamentally opposed to the conventional
theories and theological superstitious
current in their time, and so fully in harmony
with all the latest achievements in the scientific
world. History ceases to be a meaningless
mass of war and famine, bloodshed and cruelty.
It becomes a panorama presenting the development
of society according to laws which may
be understood and with a future that may be
measurably predicted.</p>

<p>It develops by the operation of forces that
no man or class can wholly stay or hinder. The
power of those forces and the direction in
which they are now making has been well set
forth by Victor Hugo by a very striking
simile in the following passage:</p>

<p>“We are in Russia. The Neva is frozen.
Heavy carriages roll upon its surface. They
improvise a city. They lay out streets. They
build houses. They buy. They sell. They
laugh. They dance. They permit themselves
anything. They even light fires on this water
become granite. There is winter, there is ice
and they shall last forever. A gleam pale and
wan spreads over the sky and one would say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
that the sun is dead. But no, thou art not
dead, oh Liberty! At an hour when they have
most profoundly forgotten thee; at a moment
when they least expect thee, thou shall arise,
oh, dazzling sight! Thou shalt shoot thy
bright and burning rays, thy heat, thy life, on
all this mass of ice become hideous and dead.
Do you hear that dull thud, that crackling,
deep and dreadful? ’Tis the Neva tearing loose.
You said it was granite. See it splits like glass.
’Tis the breaking of the ice, I tell you. ’Tis the
water alive, joyous and terrible. Progress recommences.
’Tis humanity again beginning its
march. ’Tis the river which retakes its course,
uproots, mangles, strikes together, crushes
and drowns in its waves not only the empire
of upstart Czar Nicholas, but all of the relics
of ancient and modern despotism. That
trestle work floating away? It is the throne.
That other trestle? It is the scaffold. That
old book, half sunk? It is the old code of
capitalist laws and morals. That old rookery
just sinking? It is a tenement house in which
wage slaves lived. See these all pass by;
passing by never more to return; and for this
immense engulfing, for this supreme victory of
life over death, what has been the power
necessary? One of thy looks, oh, sun! One
stroke of thy strong arm, oh, labor!”</p>

<span class="subhead">WEISMANN’S THEORY OF HEREDITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The weak, untrained brain must have a
conclusion. It cannot reserve its decision or
render an open verdict. It is completely at sea
in the scientific world where the most profound
savant is often obliged to say, “I don’t
know.” In a crowded courtroom, ninety per
cent of the spectators have made up their
minds that the prisoner is innocent or guilty
before the first witness is called or a line of
the evidence has been read. He has a square
jaw, or bushy eyebrows, or thick lips, or he
shifts uneasily from one foot to the other, any
or all which proves to the simpletons back of
the rail, that he must be guilty no matter what
the crime is, or what the evidence may be. If
he has blue eyes and fair hair and mustache,
or a pleasant manner, or pretty hands and
the onlookers were to decide the matter, they
would hardly convict him on his own confession.
In England, a judge is not placed on
the bench because he “stands in” with a ward
boss, but because of his wide scholarship and
systematic training, and the reason advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
for this method is, that only a scientific scholar
can reserve his opinion until all the evidence is
in and then, if the case demands it, render an
open verdict.</p>

<p>With the vexed problem of heredity, which
has been so much to the fore in science for the
last twenty-four years, while many great
thinkers have distinctly taken sides, it must
be remembered that in many points of great
importance, the only possible verdict on the
contentions of either side, is one of “not
proven.”</p>

<p>But although this controversy has split the
evolutionists into two camps, it in no way
compromises the evolution theory itself. The
controversy is based on the admission of all
the parties to it, that evolution is granted,
and the question at issue involves only a difference
as to how the acknowledged results are
accomplished. Evolution is no longer merely
a theory, it is an established fact, and is recognized
as such by all who live in an intellectual
atmosphere belonging to this side of
1859, the year of the publication of the “Origin
of Species.”</p>

<p>Neither does the result of this discussion
threaten, in any way, the validity of the Darwinian
theory of “Natural Selection.” All the
disputants are avowed Darwinians, and disagree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
only as to whether Darwin’s theory is
alone sufficient to account for the origin of new
species.</p>

<p>Professor Packard, Lamarck’s biographer,
and one of his warmest admirers, at the close
of his chapter devoted to the denial of “pure”
Darwinism says: “We must never forget or
under-estimate, however, the inestimable value
of the services rendered by Darwin, who by
his patience, industry, and rare genius for observation
and experiment, and his powers of
lucid exposition, convinced the world of the
truth of evolution, with the result that it has
transformed the philosophy of our day. We
are all evolutionists, though we may differ as
to the nature of the efficient causes.”</p>

<p>There are now three possible positions. (1)
That of the Lamarckians, pure and simple,
who maintain that Lamarck’s theory in itself
explains all the phenomena, and that Darwin’s
principle of selection is not only invalid but
superfluous. This school is practically extinct,
though Packard often sails to its very edge in
his efforts to defend his subject, as is the manner
of biographers. (2) The Neo- (New)-Lamarckians
who develop Lamarck’s theory
and add to it Darwin’s selective principle as of
greater, equal, or secondary importance, according
as they lean the more strongly to Darwin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
or Lamarck. This position held the field
almost alone, until Weismann fired his opening
gun in 1883. He founded (3) the Neo-Darwinian
school which repudiates altogether
the Lamarckian factor of the hereditary transmission
of acquired characters, and maintains
that Darwin’s theory is able to dispense with
Lamarckian ideas of use and disuse.</p>

<p>As Weismann is the storm center of the
controversy we will now examine his theory.</p>

<p>In 1883 Weismann became the pro-Rector of
the University of Freiburg and in the hall of
the University, in June of that year, he publicly
delivered his inaugural lecture “On Heredity.”
This lecture is generally regarded as the first
broadside in that war which filled with its
reverberations the scientific magazines of the
world for the next thirteen years. As one
writer aptly says, “The warring scientists
splashed like irate cuttle-fishes in clouds of
their own ink.” About 1896 however, the public
grew tired of the never-ending flood of biological
lore on what looked to the lay mind like
an insoluble problem. The editors, with their
fingers on the public pulse, cried, “A plague
on both your houses,” and sent the savants
to seek in their laboratories the victories denied
to their pens.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact however, the coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
struggle was foreshadowed in a paper read by
Weismann at the meeting of the Association
of the German Naturalists at Salzburg, two
years earlier, in 1881.</p>

<p>This paper was entitled “The Duration of
Life,” and the subject was still further developed
in an academic lecture, in 1883, on “Life
and Death.” These two biological contributions
not only indicated the foundations of
Weismann’s theory, but they threw a very
brilliant light in certain very dark places.
Weismann not only took up, but he solved
the hitherto obscure question of the origin of
death.</p>

<p>Johannes Muller had, as early as 1840, rejected
the prevailing hypothesis which held
the death of animals to be due to “the influences
of the organic environment, which gradually
wear away the life of the individual.”
Muller argued that if this were so “the organic
energy of an individual would steadily
decrease from the beginning.” Everybody
knows, however, that in spite of the wear and
tear caused by the “environment,” be it organic
or inorganic, the volume of life increases,
until a certain stage is reached in
all animals. But Muller had failed to fill the
gap his criticism had created.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
This problem Weismann solved by analysing
the methods of reproduction among animals.
These generally speaking are two; sexual,
and non-sexual or, as it is sometimes
termed, a-sexual. This latter form is the mode
that prevails at the bottom of the organic
scale—among the protozoa, animals consisting
of a single cell. This method has a
variety of forms which are classified by Haeckel
as (1) self-division; (2) formation of
buds; (3) the formation of germ-cells or
spores. We shall here deal only with the first,
self-division, or fission, which is the most universal
of all methods of propagation, being
the progress by which the individual cells
which compose all the higher animals multiply
themselves. This is the method vital to
Weismann’s theory and the other two are no
more than distinct modifications of fission.</p>

<p>When a Moneron or an Amoeba reaches a
certain size, it begins to pinch in the middle
like a tightly-laced corset. This increases until
the creature divides into two equal halves.
Each of these halves becomes a complete individual
which continues to thrive until the
next division takes place.</p>

<p>What Weismann observed as the most significant
thing about this was that in this process
and among these unicellular (single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
celled) organisms there is no such thing as
natural death. Accidental death is wholesale
in its proportions, but no Moneron ever dies
of old age. Astounding as it may seem to the
layman, the race-old, world-wide idea that
death is “essential to the very nature of life
itself” is here totally and indisputably overthrown.</p>

<p>“I pointed out,” says Weismann, in the second
lecture and referring to the first “that we
could not speak of natural death among unicellular
animals, for their growth has no termination
which is comparable with death. The
origin of new individuals is not connected
with the death of the old; but increase by
division takes place in such a way that the
two parts into which an organism separates
are exactly equivalent to one another, and
neither of them is older or younger than the
other. In this way countless numbers of individuals
arise, each of which is as old as the
species itself, while each possesses the capability
of living on indefinitely, by means of
divisions.”</p>

<p>Among the Metazoa, i. e., multicellular or
many celled animals, this immortality of the
individual disappears. “Here, also,” says Weismann,
“reproduction takes place by means of
cell-division, but every cell does not possess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the power of reproducing the whole organism.
The cells of the organism are differentiated
into two essentially different groups, the reproductive
cells—ova or spermatozoa—and
the somatic cells, or cells of the body. The
immortality of the unicellular organism has
passed over to the former—the reproductive
cells—the others must die, and since the
body of the individual is chiefly composed of
them, it must die also.”</p>

<p>And so death came into the world, not by
sin, as the Genesis legend reports, but through
sex; a most astonishing conclusion, it may be,
but one from which there is apparently no
escape. Immortality still remains, it is true,
but it is not the immortality of the conscious
self. Positive science, nothwithstanding all its
glorious gifts, has dealt a terrible blow to those
gorgeous dreams of primitive men and modern
mystics; those hopes and longings which have
sustained millions of our race in hours of
supreme sorrow; a blow which not even the
bravest has been able to receive without flinching.
The only immortality of which science
has any surety is that of these unconscious
single cells, which make possible the reproduction
of the species.</p>

<p>Weismann, then, divides the cells which
compose the bodies of the higher animals, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
man, into two distinct kinds; the
somatic, or body cells and the germ, or reproductive
cells. These germ cells are, so to
speak, batteries in which are stored a substance
which Weismann calls germ-plasm.
A minutely small portion of this germ-plasm
from an individual of one sex, mixed with a
similar portion from an individual of the other
will produce a new individual. But—and
here comes the keystone of Weismann’s arch—only
a portion of the mixed germ-plasm is
used up in the composition of the new individual;
the rest is stored away in the germ-cells
of the new individual for further reproduction
when the time arrives. The only relation
that this reserved germ-plasm has with
the body cells of the new individual is that it
is provided by them with room and board.</p>

<p>Thus, according to Weismann, from generation
to generation, there is an unbroken stream
of germ-plasm, and this constitutes his celebrated
theory of “The Continuity of Germ-Plasm.”
Granted this theory as a premise,
and Weismann’s conclusions cannot be gainsaid.
This germ-plasm being the sole “carrier
of heredity,” nothing that happens to the somatic
or body cells can be transmitted to the
progeny.</p>

<p>Darwin had put forward a theory of heredity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
which he called “Pangenesis,” which made
out a good case for the admission of the Lamarckian
factor. According to this theory all
the somatic or body cells give forth still
smaller cells which he calls “gemmules.”
These gemmules are collected, by some process
not explained, in the reproductive organs.
Here they are in packets, and these “packets
of gemmules” are “the carriers of heredity.”
One can easily see how by this process the
effects of use and disuse would be transmissible
for an organ shrunk by disuse would not
be capably represented by an efficient delegation
of gemmules at the reproductive headquarters.</p>

<p>Speaking of this theory, Grant Allen in his
biography of Darwin says, “Let not the love
of the biographer deceive us. Not to mince
matters, it was his one conspicuous failure,
and is now pretty universally admitted as
such.” It must be remembered however, that
Darwin was fully aware of its purely speculative
character and with his usual caution
entitled it the “Provisional Hypothesis of
Pangenesis.”</p>

<p>Romanes, one of Weismann’s ablest critics,
compares Weismann’s theory with Darwin’s,
and while he refuses to defend Pangenesis
against Weismann’s charge that it is a wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
unsupported speculation, he replies by contending
that the germ-plasm theory lives in
precisely the same kind of a glass house.</p>

<p>However that may be, it is quite clear that
the germ-plasm theory completely shuts out
the Lamarckian factor of evolution in all cases
where propagation is sexual.</p>

<p>“But,” say the Neo-Lamarckians, “Darwinism
in itself, merely assumes variations without
attempting to explain their origin. Natural
selection only explains the survival of
the fittest; it tells us nothing of what Prof.
Cope calls the ‘Origin of the Fittest.’ There
must be variation before selection, whence
then, comes this variation?” To this question
Weismann has a ready reply. “Variation is
due to the blending of two wholly different
kinds of germ-plasm at conception, producing
at birth a result that is not, and cannot be,
wholly like the contributor of either.”</p>

<p>And now, at last, the great German is in a
corner. If all variations are due to congenital
characters only, and these, of course, are only
possible because of the combinations secured
by sexual reproduction, how do variations
arise among non-sexual organisms where such
combinations cannot exist?</p>

<p>This is indeed, a poser. But any rejoicing
by Weismann’s opponents is quite premature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
The sagacity which set those opponents by
the ears is still available. There is no attempt
to untie that knot; Weismann cuts it with a
knife. He empties his antagonist’s sails by a
smiling and gracious surrender. Below the
sexually reproducing animals, he concedes the
operation of the Lamarckian factor. In that
unicellular world it is not a special cell that
is passed on but the individual itself is continued,
and of course any character acquired
by the individual will be preserved along with
the individual.</p>

<p>Thus then the region of controversy is limited
to sexually reproducing organisms and
we come to the field where the fiercest fight
was made. Do these organisms transmit by
heredity those characters or peculiarities acquired
by the individual during its own life-time?
To this question the Neo-Lamarckians
gave a positive affirmative, which Weismann
met with an unwavering denial.</p>

<p>Weismann challenged his opponents to produce
a single demonstration of such a transmission.
Here let us be clear as to what is
meant by an acquired character. For illustration,
let us suppose a father leaves his son an
estate of a thousand acres. That is inheritance.
If the son leaves his son the same one
thousand acres, that is still inheritance. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
if that son increases the estate, during his
life-time to two thousand, the second thousand
is an “acquired character” of a property
nature. There the analogy ceases for there is
no dispute as to his ability to transmit both
thousands to his heirs by inheritance.</p>

<p>But with “acquired characters” of a biological
nature, Weismann maintains this to be
impossible. Many specific instances were put
forward in refutation of this contention. Herbert
Spencer cited the case of the supposed
degeneration of the little toe in civilized man
as a result of the shoe wearing habit. This
it was urged could only have occurred through
the transmission of acquired characters and
not by natural selection as this diminished toe
could not be of any value in the struggle for
existence.</p>

<p>But it was shown by measuring the feet of
savages, who do not wear shoes, and whose
ancestors never wore them, that the small
toes of savages had degenerated quite as
much.</p>

<p>Then Cesare Lombroso entered the arena
leading a camel. According to the Italian
criminologist, the camel’s hump had been first
acquired by bearing loads and then transmitted
by heredity. From the fact that the camel
and the llama, which is smooth backed, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
something in common, he concludes that
camels are really llamas that have recently
acquired a hump in the performance of their
labors. Lombroso also supported his hump
theory by some statements about Hottentot
women having developed callouses on their
hips by carrying their children on their backs.
Unfortunately all Lombroso’s ingenuity was
wasted for we happen to possess the geological
record of the camel in good condition, and
from this history we know that the “ship of
the desert” had his hump before the human
race appeared when according to Lombroso
he should have been a smooth-backed llama.
Disappointed as Weismann’s critics were it
was hardly feasible to argue that the camel
had gotten his hump in those early times by
placing loads on his own back.</p>

<p>It was clearly seen that if a case of the
transmission of a mutilation could be established,
Weismann’s theory would be thereby
demolished. A remarkable attempt was made
in this direction in 1887 at the meeting of the
Association of the German Naturalists at
Wiesbaden. To that dignified gathering came
Dr. Zacharias with a number of tailless cats.
It was asserted that these cats had no tails
because their mother had lost her tail through
having it run over by a cart wheel. The examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of these specimens proved an entertaining
diversion from the regular proceedings,
and Prof. Eimer took them seriously
enough to refer to them in a later work as “a
valuable instance of the transmission of mutilations.”</p>

<p>Weismann, however, refused to be put
down. He insisted that in the absence of absolute
certainty as to the cart wheel incident,
they did not fulfill the first condition of scientific
evidence, and Dr. Zacharias wisely admitted
later, that this point was well taken.
Prof. Poulton had described certain cats with
extra toes which he had kept under surveillance
for seven generations. “It would be
equally justifiable,” says Weismann, “to derive
cats with extra toes from an ancestor
whose toes had been trodden on, as to derive
the tailless cats of the Isle of Man from an
ancestor of which the tail had been cut off
by a cart passing over it, and thus to regard
the existence of the race as a proof of the
transmission of mutilations.”</p>

<p>Again Weismann points out that the absence
of a tail may not be owing to the mutilation
of the mother but to the inherent taillessness
of an unknown father. He proceeds
to relate how during the year that Dr. Zacharias
came with his collection, “My friend, Prof.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Schottlius brought me a kitten with an innate
rudimentary tail, which he had accidentally
discovered as one of a family of kittens
at Waldkirch, a small town in the southern
part of the Black Forest. A closer investigation
resulted in the following rather unexpected
discovery. For some time past, tailless
kittens have frequently appeared in the families
of many different mother cats at Waldkirch,
and this fact is explained in the following
manner. A clergyman, who lived for some
time at Waldkirch had married an English
lady who possessed a tailless male Manx cat.
The probability that all the tailless cats in
Waldkirch are more or less distant descendants
of that male cat amounts almost to certainty.
Since a male Manx cat has reached the
Black Forest, it might equally well arrive at
some other place.”</p>

<p>This very same year a popular scientific
journal came to the rescue of the transmission
theory with the following incident purporting
to have taken place 22 years before, in 1864.
“A pregnant merino sheep broke its right foreleg
about two inches above the knee-joint; the
limb was put in splints and healed a long
time before the following March, when the
animal produced young. The lamb possessed
a ring of black wool from two to three inches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
in breadth round the place at which the mother’s
leg had been broken, and upon the same
leg.” When this incident was related to Weismann,
he replied, “It is a pity that the black
wool was not arranged in the form of the inscription
‘to the memory of the fractured leg
of my dear mother.’”</p>

<p>Writing in the following year Weismann
says, “Furthermore, the mutilations of certain
parts of the human body, as practised by different
nations from time immemorial, have
not in a single instance, led to the malformation
or reduction of the parts in question.
Such hereditary effects have been produced
neither by circumcision nor the removal of
the front teeth, nor the boring of holes in the
lips or nose, nor the extraordinary artificial
crushing and crippling of the feet of Chinese
women. No child among any of the nations
referred to possesses the slightest trace of
these mutilations when born; they have to be
acquired anew in each generation.”</p>

<p>While it is undoubtedly true that much in
Weismann’s position lacks experimental demonstration,
it is equally true that when the
heat of the discussion somewhat subsided, his
theories were well to the fore, and they have
since secured a wide acceptance among competent
authorities. It is hardly to be expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
that his two greatest critics, Spencer and
Haeckel, would look with much favor on a
theory the acceptance of which would make
necessary the re-writing of those many volumes
which constitute their lifework. Lankester,
himself no mean authority, in translating
Haeckel’s “History of Creation,” feels
constrained to say in the preface, “I feel it
due to myself to state that I do not agree
with him as to a very large part of his views
on classification, and as to his belief in the
necessity of assuming the ‘transmissibility of
acquired characters.’ Readers who have gained
an interest in these questions from the brief
statements of the present work must, without
assuming that Professor Haeckel’s judgment
is final, go on to study for themselves
the works of Weismann and others which are
mentioned with perfect fairness in these
pages.”</p>

<p>And Joseph McCabe, the translator of his
“Riddle of the Universe,” and “Last Words
on Evolution,” has this to say in his introduction
to the latter, written two years ago,
“To closer students, who are at times impatient
of the Lamarckian phraseology of Haeckel—to
all, in fact, who would like to see
how the same evolutionary truths are expressed
without reliance on the inheritance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
of acquired characters,—I may take the opportunity
to say that I have translated for the
same publishers, Professor Guenther’s “Darwinism
and the Problems of Life,” which will
shortly be in their hands.”</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the older view is
much less favorable to the Socialist position
in sociology than the later theory of Weismann.
It is a matter of some satisfaction
that so great a critic as Romanes concedes the
feasibility of Weismann’s theory while rejecting
some of the conclusions which he draws
from it. “If Weismann’s theory is true,” says
Prof. David Starr-Jordan, “the whole literature
of sociology will have to be rewritten!”
And another writer insisted that Weismann
had reopened the case for Socialism.</p>

<p>If it were true that the terrible results of
the degrading conditions forced upon the
dwellers in the slums were transmitted to their
children by heredity, until in a few generations
they became fixed characters, the hopes
of Socialists for a regenerated society would
be much more difficult to realize. In that case
these unfortunate creatures would continue to
act in the same discouraging way for several
generations, no matter how their environment
had been transformed by the corporate action
of society. This much at any rate, Weismann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
has done for us, he has scientifically destroyed
that lie.</p>

<p>In this respect, independent sociological experiments
and investigations have arrived at
the same conclusions as Weismann. Prof.
John R. Commons by careful study, reached
the following conclusions: That 1.75 per cent
of the population of the United States are
congenital defectives; that 3.25 per cent are
induced defectives, that is, they have not inherited
their deficiency; that 2 per cent are
possessed of genius and will make their way
under the hardest conditions; that 2 per cent
are below the Aryan brain level; and that the
remaining 91 per cent are normal persons who
are neither good nor bad, brilliant nor stupid,
criminal nor virtuous, and whose future is entirely
decided by the environment which surrounds
them during the first fifteen years of
their life.</p>

<p>Herman Whittaker, a magazine contributor,
states that during eight years in Canada 2,000
boys taken from the London slums by Dr.
Barnado passed under his observation on a
farm colony. And although most of them had
served terms in jail, not more than one per
cent reverted to their own former habits, or
the habits of their parents.</p>

<p>When it is charged that a transformed social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
environment will not solve the problem
presented by the slum, the sweatshop and the
jail, as Socialists assert, we are justified in
nailing the statement as false, and a libel on
human nature. And in so doing, we are not
sentimental dreamers of dreams, crying for
the moon, but rigid analysts and investigators,
and, as Lassalle once proudly said, “We
have behind us the science and the learning
of our day.”</p>

<span class="subhead">DE VRIES’ “MUTATION.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Orthodoxy received the most stunning blow
ever given it, at the hands of Charles Darwin,
and it is ever on the lookout for an opportunity
to make reprisals. It is only necessary for
some fledgling to challenge Darwin’s theory
of the origin of coral reefs and offer some
grotesque assumption in its place, and it is at
once announced from a thousand pulpits that
Darwinism,—that enemy of God and man—is
dead.</p>

<p>Hugo DeVries, however, could hardly be
called a fledgling, and the supporters of Darwin
had real cause for apprehension, it would
seem, when the rumor gained ground that no
less a person than the Amsterdam professor
had overthrown Darwin’s theory, and substituted
one of his own.</p>

<p>Alas, this latest “death of Darwinism” was
no more fatal than its numerous predecessors,
as the following quotation from DeVries himself
will show:</p>

<p>“My work claims to be in full accord with
the principles laid down by Darwin.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
again, “To Darwin was reserved the task of
bringing the theory of common descent to its
present high rank in scientific and social philosophy.”
And, “Notwithstanding all these
apparently unsurmountable difficulties, (absence
of experimental evidence since gathered)
Darwin discovered the great principle
which rules the evolution of organisms. It is
the principle of natural selection. It is the
sifting out of all organisms of minor worth
through the struggle for life.”</p>

<p>The greater part of the adverse criticism,
aimed at Darwinism applies only to the extravagant
claims put forward by his overenthusiastic
disciples; claims not to be found
in the works of Darwin himself. As we shall
see later, one of the greatest offenders in this
respect was no less a person than the co-discoverer
of the selection theory—Alfred Russell
Wallace.</p>

<p>Of all the mischievous misconceptions of
Darwin’s theory none have worked so much
harm as that which regards natural selection
as the active and efficient cause of evolution.
Although evolution is an established fact, our
knowledge of its processes are incomplete and
must always remain so until we have solved
that most vexed of all biological problems, the
“causes of variation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
As to the nature of these causes, natural
selection is dumb. For its purpose, variation
is simply assumed to be a fact, and Darwin’s
acknowledged ignorance as to how variation
is brought about is expressed in the term
“spontaneous variation.” Until variation has
played its part by producing new and various
forms, selection has no function or office to
perform. Then it simply decides which forms
shall survive by destroying the rest. As Wigand
has pointed out, selection does not do
more than determine the survival of what is
offered to it, and does not create anything
new. As DeVries very strikingly puts it, “It
is only a sieve, and not a force of nature, no
direct cause of improvement, as many of Darwin’s
adversaries, and unfortunately many of
his followers also, have so often asserted. It
is only a sieve which decides which is to live
and which is to die.... With the single steps
of evolution it has nothing to do. Only after
the step has been taken, the sieve acts, eliminating
the unfit.” Thus Prof. Cope’s point
that Darwin’s theory does not explain the
“origin” of the fittest, is well taken, or as Mr.
Arthur Harris puts it, “Natural selection may
explain the survival of the fittest, but it cannot
explain the arrival of the fittest.”</p>

<p>It was around this question of the “causes”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of variation that the Neo-Lamarckians and
the Weismannians fought their battle, the former
insisting, as we have seen, that variation
was caused by the hereditary transmission of
acquired characters, while Weismann maintained
that variation arose solely through the
combining of two portions of differing germ-plasm
contributed by two different individuals,
and producing a new individual unlike
either,—a “variation” from both. While whatever
there was of victory fell to Weismann,
neither side has experimentally proven its
case, and we are still in the dark as to the
“causes of variation.” Our ignorance is still
cloaked in the convenient word “spontaneous;”
to Darwin’s “spontaneous variation” we
now add DeVries’ “spontaneous mutation.”</p>

<p>It is another tribute to Darwin’s caution
and insight that he recognized the possibility
of variations arising either suddenly, as DeVries
asserts they do, or gradually as DeVries
denies.</p>

<p>Not only did Alfred Russell Wallace seek
to limit the operation of natural selection in
certain fields, in order to make room for his
spiritualist theories—an adventure which
failed dismally—but he denied the sudden
appearance of new species or sub-species,
thereby restricting Darwinism, as he understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
it, to the origin of new species by the
gradual accumulation of those almost imperceptible
variations usually described as “fluctuations.”
Whatever conflict there may be
between Darwinism and mutation must be
ascribed to Wallace. As DeVries clearly recognizes,
Darwin is in no way responsible.
“Darwin,” says DeVries, “recognized both
lines of evolution.”</p>

<p>The difference between “fluctuations” and
“mutation” is illustrated by DeVries recalling
Galton’s simile of a polyhedron—an example
of which is a solid piece of glass covered with
many small flat faces. When it comes to rest
on any particular face, it is in stable equilibrium.
Small disturbances may make it oscillate,
but it returns always to the same face.
These oscillations are like fluctuating variations.
A greater disturbance may cause the
polyhedron to roll over on to a new face,
where it comes to rest again, only showing
the ever present fluctuations around the new
center. The new position corresponds to a
mutation. One of the disabilities of this illustration
is that some fluctuations represent a
greater disturbance from the given position
than some mutations. The essential difference
is that in the fluctuation it rocks back again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
while in the mutation it remains on a new
base.</p>

<p>Everybody has heard something of the famous
evening primrose which gave DeVries
his first and most conclusive evidence of mutation.
At Hilversum near Amsterdam, he
discovered a large number of the plants of the
evening primrose, named Lamarckiana after
Lamarck. It is an American plant imported
to Europe. It often escapes from cultivation
and in this case DeVries says it had escaped
from a park. It had run wild ten years. A
year after first noticing them DeVries observed
two new forms which he at once recognized
as two new elementary species.</p>

<p>In the test conditions of his own garden, in
an experiment covering thirteen years, he
observed over fifty thousand of the Lamarckiana
spread over eight generations and of these
eight hundred were mutations divided among
seven new elementary species. These mutations,
when self-fertilized, or fertilized from
plants like themselves, bred true to themselves,
thus answering the test of a real species.
DeVries also watched the field from
which his original forms were taken, and saw
that similar mutations occurred there so that
they were not in any way due to cultivation.</p>

<p>Thus has the modest mutating primrose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
contributed its quota to the solution of that
riddle of the universe which, until it is solved,
will always command a paramount position in
the thoughts of men.</p>

<p>DeVries discourages the notion that mutations
are always occurring everywhere, which
might seem to be one of the inferences from
his theory, and his twenty-fourth lecture of
the series, delivered before the University of
California is entitled “The Hypothesis of Periodic
Mutations.” The common primrose, he
says, seems to be immutable at present, and
argues that it must have had a mutatory period
sometime in the past, when, perhaps, the
evening primrose was not mutating. He says:
“All the facts point to the conclusion that
these periods, of stability and mutability, alternate
more or less regularly with one another.”</p>

<p>He deals the Neo-Lamarckians a heavy
blow by his denial of “direct” adaptation, and
he greatly strengthens their opponents when
he asserts that mutation takes place, not only
in useful directions, but in all directions, leaving
natural selection to destroy the unfit. This
is a restatement of Darwin’s conception, followed
by Weismann, of “fortuitous” variations,
and is contrary to the notion of Spencer
and Haeckel, that variations are mainly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
direction of adaptation to environment, as a
result of animals exerting themselves in that
direction.</p>

<p>This point is well stated by DeVries in the
following passage,—“This failure of a large
part of the productions of nature deserves to
be considered at some length. It may be elevated
to a principle, and may be made use
of to explain many difficult points of the theory
of descent. If in order to secure one good
novelty nature must produce ten or twenty or
perhaps more bad ones at the same time, the
possibility of improvements coming by pure
chance must be granted at once. All hypotheses
concerning the direct causes of adaptation
at once become superfluous, and the
great principle enunciated by Darwin once
more reigns supreme.”</p>

<p>Another difficulty which DeVries claims to
have solved by his theory, is the supposed
contradiction between the physicist and the
biologist as to the time allowed by the former
and the time required by the latter, for the
evolution of animals.</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin asserted the age of the earth to
be between twenty and forty million years.
George Darwin estimates the separation of
the moon from the earth as having taken place
some fifty-six million years ago. Gekie estimated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the existence of the solid crust of the
earth as at most hundred million years.
Joly, by calculating the amount of dissolved
salts, and Dubois by the amount of lime, estimated
the age of the rivers, Joly giving as
probable fifty-five and Dubois thirty-six millions
of years.</p>

<p>“All in all,” concludes DeVries, “it seems
evident that the duration of life does not comply
with the demands of the conception of
very slow and continuous evolution.” Mutation,
with its sudden leaps, has no such difficulty,
and,—“The demands of the biologists
and the results of the physicists are harmonized
on the ground of the theory of mutation.”</p>

<p>In order properly to estimate the sociological
significance of DeVries’ theory it will be
necessary to go back more than a century, and
observe the sociological import of the leading
biological ideas of that period.</p>

<p>And here let us remark, that nobody knows
better than we do the danger of transplanting,
without criticism, biological theories into the
field of sociology. Nevertheless, our opponents
have never lost an opportunity to twist
and distort science, if perchance by any possibility
it could be made to contradict anything
that had so much as the semblance of
Socialism. We, however, have always insisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
on the weakness of reasoning by mere analogy
and have kept to those general laws
which have been worked out separately in sociology.</p>

<p>The principle now about to be applied belongs
to this latter class. It is the most luminous
principle ever employed in the interpretation
of the phenomena of society. This principle
is that the intellectual life of a people is
determined by its mode of wealth production
and the social classes arising therefrom.</p>

<p>Jean Lamarck, the first great modern apostle
of evolution, died in poverty because he advocated
a theory that appeared to contradict
the interests of the ruling class of his time.
He had against him all that survived of feudal
interests, which was intensely theological, and
although his theory really favored the bourgeoisie,
that class was not yet aware of it.</p>

<p>Cuvier was the lion of that day, for he managed
the remarkable feat of adapting science
to the ideas, not only of the increasing bourgeoisie,
but also of the diminishing feudal
power. He pleased the feudal regime, such of
it as remained, by denying evolution, and endorsing
its theology. This made his theories
welcome also among those shrewd early capitalists,
as the English, who realized more
quickly than their fellows, that religious belief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
might constitute as great a prop for one ruling
class at it had already been for another.</p>

<p>But in his capacity of scientific reflection of
the class interest of his masters, Cuvier’s masterpiece
was his “cataclysmic theory.” According
to this theory, organisms were not
the result of evolution, but they were now just
as when they issued from the hands of the
Creator. The difference between existing
forms, and those creatures whose story is
preserved in the rocks, was explained by a
series of cataclysms or catastrophes by which,
at certain widely separated periods, all living
forms were destroyed, and a completely new
stock was created to take their places.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to conceive a better
scientific justification of the French revolution
than Cuvier’s theory presented. For many
decades before that event these rising commercialists
had groaned under the yoke of
feudal dues and feudal restraints of trade.
Nothing could be more to their wishes than
a sudden social “cataclysm” that would destroy
the feudal system with its trade despising
and plundering nobility, and exalt its own
trading class to fill the vacancy. And when
this had been accomplished, and that same
nobility had been sent to the guillotine, it
was great consolation to have on Cuvier’s authority,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
that this method of sudden violence
had no less a precedent than the methods of
the Almighty in suddenly destroying the living
things in his own universe.</p>

<p>Cuvier’s theory however, almost died with
him, for the violent desires of the bourgeoisie
were short lived. When it realized the completeness
of its own victory, and that the next
“cataclysm” would mean its own overthrow
and the enthronement of some successor, cataclysms
lost favor and were frowned down.
Preachers of sudden and violent changes were
now regarded as the enemies of society, and
Cuvier’s once lauded theory of cataclysms was
sneered at as a relic of the dark ages. What
the capitalist class wanted now was peace, and
long life, and above all, no disturbances.</p>

<p>And it was just at this point that Darwin
came forward with a theory that seemed made
to order. True this theory spoke of evolution
and change, but the change was so slow it
was impossible to notice it. A million years
was as ten minutes to this theory, and if it
took as long for one class in society to displace
another, or for one social regime to succeed
another, as it does for one species to develop
from another, the capitalists and their
heirs had nothing to apprehend for a thousand
generations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
There was nothing sudden about this theory,
quite the contrary. In fact the real difficulty
was to see how anything managed to
change at all.</p>

<p>As for that part of it which spoke of the
survival of the fittest, what could be clearer
than that these self-made men were themselves
the fittest. It was, of course equally
clear that the degraded working class, lacking
the cleverness to rise, was destined to be eliminated
as unfit, by the laws of nature.</p>

<p>For half a century this argument of slow
evolution has done valiant service as an antidote
for Socialism, and the present ruling class
would like to retain it forever.</p>

<p>But no ruling class ever was or ever can
be wholly omnipotent. The capitalists of to-day
can no more hinder the process of social
evolution, with its resulting march of ideas,
than they can intercept gravitation or divert
the tides. They are being driven blindly to
their fate by social forces which are beyond
their command.</p>

<p>They are in the midst of social powers
which mock their puny efforts to administer.
Contradictions arise which cannot continue.
As soon as a capitalist country is over-stocked
with wealth, poverty prepares to stalk abroad.</p>

<p>But amid all this confusion, something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
moves on, a something which we sometimes
call the spirit of the age. Society grows restless
and instinctively anticipates a coming
change. A new class rises into prominence
and begins to realize its strength and develop
its intelligence.</p>

<p>The ruling class still proclaims its will, but
cannot always execute it. Colorado, Idaho,
and Haywood are proof of that. The mental
development of this new class has reached the
point where it has become an intellectual factor
in the national life. Its voice is listened to
by publishers of books. It establishes its own
press. It publishes a literature of its own. It
creates its own platform. It reaches into the
future and demands control of its own destiny.</p>

<p>And now see how all this is reflected in the
scientific world. It is no longer true that species
require thousands of years for the simplest
change. We are now informed that
change takes place by sudden leaps. At one
single step a new species appears and begins
its existence. There is therefore, no longer
anything in biological science to contradict
the Socialist position that a new society may
be born of a sudden revolution.</p>

<p>Mutation, the savants tell us, runs in periods,
alternating with periods of apparent stability.
Then if we are not supported we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
at any rate not contradicted, when we assert
that in social development, periods of economic
evolution, with apparent social stability,
are followed by periods of social revolution
when the entire social superstructure is transformed.</p>

<p>It is no longer necessary to assume countless
millions of years for the evolution of living
forms. A plant enjoys a period of apparent
stability, then it reaches a point where it
“explodes” and gives birth to new species. If
a plant, why not a society? At least there is
nothing in the example of the plant that will
furnish an argument against such an idea.</p>

<p>If the history of biological science for the
last half a century were to be written by a
Socialist, who had no scruples about wresting
the record so as to support his Socialist theories,
he would have nothing to gain by changing
a single line.</p>

<p>There is nothing in that history to contradict
us when we assert the probability or the
certainty, of a social revolution. Who, that
looks about him, can fail to see that death is
plainly branded in the brow of the existing
social order? Its legal, political, and financial
institutions are tied together with rotten
thread. It is already outliving its usefulness,
and when it goes it will have few mourners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
But millions will hail with joy that social mutation
which will kindle the fires of human
liberty, and create, if not a new Heaven, at
least, a new earth.</p>

<span class="subhead">KROPOTKIN’S “MUTUAL AID.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Lamarck was the first to present the theory
of Evolution in a thoroughly scientific manner.
Then Darwin discovered “the great principle
which rules the evolution of organisms”;
the principle of “natural selection.” Then
Weismann repudiated current ideas as to how
the fittest “arrived,” or “originated,” and presented
in their place a theory of his own,
which is still under discussion. DeVries
raised the question as to whether new species
“arrive” by a gradual accumulation of
tiny changes, or by sudden leaps—mutations—and
demonstrated the latter by his
experiments with the evening primrose.</p>

<p>And now comes Kropotkin with the question,
“Who are the fittest?” What constitutes
the fitness, which makes for survival? Are
those organisms the fittest which are constantly
waging a war of extermination against
every other organism in the struggle for existence,
or, are those the fittest which co-operate
with each other in the preservation of
the common life of all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
The raising of this question brings to light
another striking instance of the influence of
class interests on scientific thought. It is a
matter of common observation that any class,
struggling for what it conceives to be its own
emancipation, looks to the past for justification
and precedent. In the English speaking
world there is a widely prevailing opinion that
the Magna Charta, extorted from King John
at Runnymede, is the foundation of modern
liberty.</p>

<p>The French bourgeoisie, struggling to overthrow
the feudal monarchy, sought its justification
in that “state of nature” which a despotic
monarchy was said to contravene.
Thus writers like Rousseau idealized nature,
representing it as comparatively perfect, and
declared that a restoration of “natural rights”
was essential to liberty. But when this same
bourgeoisie had won its victory and enthroned
itself, and instead of increasing the liberty,
had in many respects, deepened the degradation
of the mass of the French people, its
ideas about the “state of nature” underwent a
radical change. And this happened not only
in France but wherever the bourgeoisie triumphed.</p>

<p>Now the “state of nature” was one of constant
carnage; nature was “red in tooth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
claw.” And this chamber of horrors was supposed
to support the exploitation of labor, and
countenance a brutalization of childhood that
constitutes the blackest stain on human history.
So strong was the swirl that Huxley
was swept into it; but, although he maintained
the “gladiatorial” view of nature, he
repudiated the social atrocities which capitalist
apologists such as Spencer sought to deduce
from it. In later years, Spencer partially
abandoned his premise as to the animal world
but, strangely enough, kept it intact for primitive
man.</p>

<p>For this view of nature as full of nothing
but darkness and cruelty, where, as Hobbes
had put it, there waged “the war of every one
against everybody,” the great authority of
Darwin was invoked. In fact, Darwin was
supposed to be almost solely responsible for
the theory, and its overthrow by Kropotkin
was heralded by the uninformed as another of
those “death-blows” of which Darwinism is
thought to have received so many during the
last quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Kropotkin, however, in his introduction,
claims that the idea of mutual aid is “in reality,
nothing but a further development of the
ideas expressed by Darwin in the ‘Descent of
Man’”. Darwin said: “Those communities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
which included the greatest number of sympathetic
members would flourish best, and
rear the greatest number of offspring.” Kropotkin
complains that Darwin did not sufficiently
develop this idea, but over-emphasized
the idea of “competition” for life, and this
error, he insists, was further accentuated by
his disciples. “It happened with Darwin’s
theory,” he says, “as it always happens with
theories having any bearing upon human relations.
Instead of widening it according to
his own hints, his followers narrowed it still
more.”</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that Kropotkin
denies the Darwinian principle of mutual
struggle. “It is evident,” says he, “that no
review of evolution can be complete unless
these two dominant currents are analyzed. * * *
The struggles between these two forces make,
in fact, the substance of history.” He anticipates
the objection that his work only emphasizes
the principle of mutual aid by insisting
that the principle of struggle has “already
been analyzed, described, and glorified from
time immemorial. In fact, up to the present
time, this current alone has received attention
from the epical poet, the annalist, the historian,
and the sociologist.”</p>

<p>The main body of his book is a solid mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
of evidence of the existence of mutual aid
everywhere in the living world, from the lowest
insects to the highest mammals; and from
the first stone age to the twentieth century.
It consists of eight chapters, the first two of
which are devoted to “Mutual Aid among
Animals.”</p>

<p>Here, the theory of the human origin of society
is utterly demolished. Complex social
arrangements, popularly supposed to be limited
to ants and bees, are shown to flourish
everywhere, especially among birds.</p>

<p>With the parrot mutual aid is developed to
such an extent that Kropotkin places it “at
the very top of the whole feathered world for
the development of its intelligence.” The
white cockatoos of Australia, in raiding a
crop, mutually aid each other so shrewdly as
to “baffle all stratagems” to thwart them. “Before
starting to plunder a cornfield, they first
send out a reconnoitering party which occupies
the highest trees in the vicinity of the
field, while other scouts perch upon the intermediate
trees between the field and the forest
and transmit signals. If the report runs ‘all
right,’ a score of cockatoos will separate from
the bulk of the band, take a flight in the air,
and then fly towards the trees nearest to the
field. They also will scrutinize the neighborhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
for a long while, and only then will give
the signal for general advance, after which the
whole band starts at once and plunders the
field in no time.”</p>

<p>Mutual aid is very conspicuous among pelicans.
“They always go fishing in numerous
bands and after having chosen an appropriate
bay, they form a wide half circle in face of
the shore, and narrow it by paddling towards
the shore, catching all the fish that happen to
be enclosed in the circle. On narrow rivers
and canals they even divide into two parties,
each of which draws up on a half circle, and
both paddle to meet each other, just as if two
parties of men dragging two long nets should
advance to capture all the fish taken between
the nets when both parties come to meet.”</p>

<p>Our familiar friend, the house sparrow, is
not overlooked and is said to have practiced
mutual aid to such an extent as to be recognized
even by the ancient Greeks. Kropotkin
quotes from memory, the Greek Orator who
exclaimed: “While I am speaking to you a
sparrow has come to tell other sparrows that
a slave has dropped on the floor a sack of
corn, and they all go there to feed on the
grain.” Sparrows also maintain social discipline:
“If a lazy sparrow intends appropriating
the nest a comrade is building, or even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
steals from it a few sprays of straw, the group
interferes against the lazy comrade.” Kropotkin
presents a number of well authenticated
observations of the great compassion and sympathy
prevailing among those wild creatures,
which are popularly supposed to be always
flying at each others’ throats: J. C. Woods’
narrative “of a weasel which came to pick up
and carry away an injured comrade;” Brehm,
who “himself saw two crows feeding in a hollow
tree a third crow which had a wound
several weeks old.” Captain Stansbury, on his
journey to Utah, as quoted by Darwin, “saw
a blind pelican which was fed, and well fed,
by other pelicans upon fishes which had to
be brought a distance of thirty miles.”</p>

<p>From these and a multitude of similar cases
Kropotkin concludes that while “no naturalist
will doubt that the idea of a struggle for life,
carried on through organic nature, is the
greatest generalization of our century, that
struggle is very often collective, against adverse
circumstances.”</p>

<p>Kropotkin in concluding his consideration
of animals, immensely strengthens his position
by pointing out various methods by
which new species may develop or old ones
disappear, without the operation of a deadly
competition between individuals. “The squirrels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
for instance, when there is a scarcity of
cones in the larch forests, remove to the fir-tree
forests, and this change of food has certain
well known physiological effects on squirrels.
If this change of habits does not last—if
next year the cones are again plentiful in
the dark larch wood—no new variety of
squirrels will evidently arise from this cause.
But if part of the wide area occupied by the
squirrels begins to have its physical characters
altered—in consequence of, let us say,
a milder climate or desiccation, (drying up)
which both bring about an increase of the pine
forests in proportion to the larch woods—and
if some other conditions occur to induce
squirrels to dwell on the outskirts of the desiccating
region—we shall then have a new,
i. e., an incipient new species of squirrels. A
larger proportion of squirrels of the new, better-adapted
variety would survive each year,
and the intermediate links would die in the
course of time, without having been starved
out by Malthusian competitors.”</p>

<p>Again: “If we take the horses and cattle
which are grazing all the winter through in
the Steppes of Transbaikalia, we find them
very lean and exhausted at the end of the
winter. But they grow exhausted not because
there is not enough food for all of them—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
grass buried under a thin sheet of snow is
everywhere in abundance—but because of
the difficulty of getting it from beneath the
snow and this difficulty is the same for all
horses alike. * * * We can safely say that
their number are not kept down by competition;
that at no time of the year they need
struggle, for food and that if they never reach
anything, approaching over-population, the
cause is in the climate, and not in competition.”</p>

<p>After citing the rodents that combine to
store food for the winter, or fall asleep about
the time competition should set in; and the
buffaloes which form immense herds to migrate
across a continent to where food is plentiful;
and beavers, which when they grow
numerous, divide into two parties, and go, the
old ones down the river, and the young ones
up the river and avoid competition; after citing
these and many others, he declares the
mandate of nature to be: “Don’t compete!—competition
is always injurious to the species,
and you have plenty of resources to avoid it!
* * * Therefore combine—practice mutual
aid! That is the surest means for giving to
each and to all the greatest safety, the best
guarantee of existence and progress, bodily,
intellectually, and morally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
The third chapter deals with “Mutual Aid
Among Savages.” Here we meet the question
as to whether the family is an ancient institution,
antedating the tribe and clan or
whether it appeared at a much later date as
an outgrowth of the clan. Kropotkin takes
the latter view as advocated by Morgan, Bachofen,
Maine, Lubbock and Tylor, and rejects
the former as presented by Starcke and
Westermarck.</p>

<p>The savage of anthropological research is
shown to be a very different creature from the
blood-thirsty monster of popular tradition.
“Sometimes he is a cannibal, it is true, but not
often, and then it is closely associated with
economic necessity, and is abandoned when
food becomes plentiful.” The custom of leaving
old men in the woods to die, is bad
enough, but not so bad as supposed. They
usually carry the old man with them in their
migrations until he himself grows tired of being
a burden and begs to be killed. When
this point is reached, he is given more than
his share of food, and left in the woods to
die, because no one has the heart to kill him.
Infanticide is practiced from the same motive
which induces savages to take all kinds of
measures for diminishing the birth-rate—they
cannot rear all of their children. In times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
of plenty it disappears. It was when these
customs were enveloped in a religious halo
and preserved as sacred ceremonies, after all
necessity for them had disappeared, that they
attained their most revolting characters.</p>

<p>He believed in revenge but it was to be
strictly measured by the offense. It must be
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; not
a head for an eye, or an eye for a tooth. He
only killed his enemies, and he always, at all
costs, defended the members of his own tribe.
“Within the tribe everything is shared in
common; every morsel of food is divided
among all present; and if the savage is alone
in the woods, he does not begin his meal until
he has loudly shouted thrice an invitation
to any one who may hear his voice to share
his meal.”... “If he infringes one of the
smaller tribal rules, he is prosecuted by the
mockeries of the women.” “When he enters
his neighbors’ territory he must loudly announce
his coming, and if he enters a house
he must deposit his hatchet at the entrance.
If one shows greediness when spoil is divided
all the others give him their share to shame
him.” Scolding and scorning are greatly condemned.
Their children are not very quarrelsome
and very rarely fight. The most they
may say, is, “Your mother does not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
sewing,” or “Your father is blind of one eye.”</p>

<p>The savage identified his interests with
those of his tribe; he was no individualist,
and under no circumstances would he have
consented to child labor.</p>

<p>When we reach the barbarians, who are considered
in the fourth chapter, we enter the historical
period. At first sight, mutual aid seems
to be non-existent at this period. Here there
seems to be nothing but battle and bloodshed.
But the reason is not far to seek; it is because,
until recently historians regaled us exclusively
with what has been aptly called, “drum
and trumpet history.” “They hand down to
posterity the most minute descriptions of every
war, every battle and skirmish, every
contest and act of violence, every kind of individual
suffering; but they hardly give any
trace of the countless acts of mutual support
and devotion which every one of us knows
from his own experience * * * The annalists
of old never failed to chronicle the petty wars
and calamities which harrassed their contemporaries
but they paid no attention whatever
to the life of the masses, although the masses
chiefly used to toil peacefully while the few
indulged in fighting.”</p>

<p>But Sir Henry Maine in his work on the
“Origin of International Law,” has fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
proved that “Man has never been so ferocious
or so stupid as to submit to such an evil as
war without some kind of an effort to prevent
it.” And he has shown how exceedingly great
is “the number of ancient institutions which
bear the marks of a design to stand in the way
of war, or to provide an alternative to it.”</p>

<p>A pregnant suggestion is offered as to the
causes of that great migration of barbarians
which resulted in the overthrow of the Roman
empire. “It is desiccation, a quite recent desiccation
continued still at a speed which we formerly
were not prepared to admit. Against it
man was powerless. When the inhabitants of
North-West Mongolia and East Turkestan
saw that water was abandoning them they
had no course open to them but to move
down the broad valleys leading to the lowlands,
and to thrust westward the inhabitants
of the plains.” And so the one great war
recorded of the barbarians, was thrust upon
them by absolute physical necessity.</p>

<p>The barbarians had no social problem, for
that private property in the means of life
which constitutes the foundation of modern
individualism, and from which the degradation
and poverty of modern civilization results,
was unknown among them. They were communists.
The interest of one was the care of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
all. Nothing was owned privately until it
reached the very point of consumption and
not always then, as food was largely eaten at
communal meals. This social form still survives
especially in Russia, and Kropotkin
says: “The sight of a Russian commune mowing
a meadow—the men rivalling each other
in their advance with the scythe, while the
women turn the grass over and throw it up
into heaps—is one of the most inspiring
sights; it shows what human work might be
and ought to be. The hay, in such case, is
divided among the separate households, and
it is evident that no one has the right of taking
hay from a neighbor’s stack without his
permission; but the limitation of this last rule
among the Caucasian Ossetes is most noteworthy.
When the cuckoo cries and announces
that spring is coming, and that the meadows
will soon be clothed again with grass,
every one in need has the right of taking from
a neighbor’s stack the hay he wants for his
cattle. The old communal rights are thus reasserted,
as if to prove how contrary unbridled
individualism is to human nature.”</p>

<p>When the early Christians “had all things
in common,” they were not reaching forward
to modern Socialism; they were harking back
to this primitive communism which shed its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
joy and plenty on the sons and daughters of
men for a thousand generations. These barbarian
communists were thorough democrats,
and their folkmotes, where everybody gathered
and had their say, were the only semblance of
government they possessed, and so thoroughly
were its decisions respected that no officers
were needed to enforce them. They were also
our superiors not only in refusing to work their
children, but also in scorning to beat them.
They said: “The body of the child reddens
from the stroke, but the face of him who
strikes reddens from shame.”</p>

<p>The two chapters on “Mutual Aid in the
Medieval City” treat the guild as the chief
manifestation of the principle during this period.
A picture is presented, in some detail
of the struggle of the free cities against the
increasing encroachments of the centralizing
states. The medieval cities are finally defeated,
the guilds destroyed, but the indestructible
principle of mutual aid takes on new
forms and accommodates itself to new conditions.</p>

<p>This brings us to the closing chapters on
“Mutual Aid Among Ourselves.” The first of
these two chapters is devoted almost entirely
to the mutual aid habits and institutions which
still survive in the present day villages of Russia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Switzerland, France and Germany. The
last chapter takes up really modern instances
of the principle, the first and most important
are the Labor unions and their strikes, Co-operative
societies, Life-boat associations,
Charitable organizations.</p>

<p>The illustration of this principle which is
cited first after the Labor union is the Socialist
movement. Kropotkin presents his conception
of the Socialist movement as a manifestation
of mutual aid in existing society in
the following eloquent passage:</p>

<p>“Every experienced politician knows that
all great political movements were fought
upon large and often distant issues, and that
those of them were the strongest which provoked
most disinterested enthusiasm. All
great historical movements have had this
character, and for our own generation Socialism
stands in that case. ‘Paid agitators,’ is,
no doubt, the favorite refrain of those who
know nothing about it. The truth however,
is that—to speak only of what I know personally—if
I had kept a diary for the last
twenty-four years, the reader of such a diary
would have had the word ‘heroism’ constantly
on his lips. But the men I would have spoken
of were not heroes; they were average men,
inspired by a grand idea. Every Socialist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
newspaper—and there are hundreds of them
in Europe alone—has the same history of
years of sacrifice without any hope of reward,
and, in the overwhelming majority of cases,
even without any personal ambition. I have
seen families living without knowing what
would be their food tomorrow, the husband
boycotted all round in his little town for his
part in the paper, and the wife supporting the
family by sewing, and such a situation lasting
for years, until the family would retire,
without a word of reproach, simply saying:
‘Continue; we can hold out no more!’ I have
seen men, dying from consumption, and knowing
it, and yet knocking about in snow and
fog to prepare meetings within a few weeks
from death, and only then retiring to the hospital
with the words: ‘Now friends I am
done; the doctors say I have but a few weeks
to live. Tell the comrades I shall be happy
if they come to see me.’ I have seen facts
that would be described as ‘idealization’ if I
told them in this place; and the very names
of these men, hardly known outside a narrow
circle of friends, will soon be forgotten
when the friends too have passed away. In
fact, I don’t know myself which most to admire,
the unbounded devotion of these few or
the sum total of petty acts of devotion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
great number. Every quire of a penny paper
sold, every meeting, every hundred votes
which are won at a Socialist election, represent
an amount of energy and sacrifices of
which no outsider has the faintest idea. And
what is now done by Socialists has been done
by every popular and advanced party, political
and religious, in the past. All past progress
has been promoted by like men and by a like
devotion.”</p>

<span class="subhead">A REPLY TO HAECKEL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The revolt against “authority” has been carried
to ridiculous extremes. The Manchester
school individualist, Herbert Spencer, and the
metaphysical egoist, Max Stirner, would alike
agree to the reduction of all authority to the
smallest possible residue. The most reckless
of their disciples, having shut out from their
thoughts all communication with the world
of reality, would make it impossible for six
men to pull effectively on a rope because five
of them would be obliged to recognize the
authority of the sixth, when he, at the proper
moment, should call “Heave, ho.”</p>

<p>To thinkers of this order, music would be
impossible. Who could imagine a radical individualist
bowing to a waved stick and recognizing
the highly centralized authority of
the “leader.” The music of the logical, authority-repudiating
individualist, would be the
haphazard beating of the tom-tom of the East
Indian, and not the highly regulated strains of
a modern orchestra.</p>

<p>This folly is equalled, if not out-done, by
those who refuse to recognize authority in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
science and thought. When a man claims to
have a new and fundamental discovery in
astronomy, and at the same time speaks
slightingly of the researches of physicists such
as Newton, Kant, and Laplace, it is fairly safe
to conclude that you are listening to a fool
who has nothing to say worthy of a second
thought. Not until one has trodden every
rung of the ladder which has been previously
trodden, is he able to mount a step higher.
And it is the performance of this task, wholly,
or at least in the first part, that constitutes the
one so doing an “authority.”</p>

<p>How often does one hear an addle-brained,
know-nothing say: “I recognize no authority;
I think for myself.” How shall one think without
ideas? And how is it possible to obtain
ideas apart from the acquisition of knowledge?
And where can knowledge be obtained
except from those who have it?</p>

<p>All “authority” in science and thought is
founded on knowledge of the subject in question.
Socialists quote Karl Marx as an authority
on political economy, because his writings
prove that he knew more about the production
and distribution of wealth than any
man of his century. Lavoisier is an authority
in chemistry, because he know more about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
composition of substances than any three of
his contemporaries.</p>

<p>But much confusion has been wrought, by
men of undisputed authority in their own
field, pronouncing positive verdicts in departments
where their opinions had no value.
What a great composer has to say about the
value of a certain note must be respectfully
considered as being of importance, but, unless
he has studied geology, his opinions on
the probable origin or age of the Rocky Mountains
will have no more value, and may have
less than those of the policeman on the nearest
corner.</p>

<p>An excellent example of the confusion
which may arise in this way, was given to
the world in 1877, at the Congress of Naturalists
held at Munich in September of that
year. At that time the naturalists of Europe
were divided into two opposing camps, one
accepting and the other rejecting the Darwinian
theory of “natural selection.” The leaders
of both divisions were Germans, though a
preponderance of the Germans favored Darwin,
whilst the French, still under the influence
of, or agreeing with, Flourens, although
he had been dead a decade, were almost
unanimously opposed.</p>

<p>The honors of leading the fight for Darwinism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
at the Munich Congress, fell to Haeckel,
and on the 18th of September he threw down
the gage in a brilliant address in which he defended
the ideas of the great Englishman.
Haeckel also advocated the teaching of evolution
in the schools. The battle raged back
and forth between the two armies, until
Virchow, the great pathologist, dropped a
bombshell in the Congress by boldly asserting:
“Darwinism leads directly to Socialism.”</p>

<p>Here biological arguments ceased. The only
thing in order was to clear the skirts of Darwinism
of the terrible charge of being socialistic.
Of course this task fell to Haeckel, and
he was loyally assisted by Oscar Schmidt.</p>

<p>Writing in “Ausland” two months later
Schmidt said: “If the Socialists were prudent
they would do their utmost to kill by silent
neglect, the theory of descent, for that theory
most emphatically proclaims that the Socialist
ideas are impracticable.”</p>

<p>Haeckel replied to Virchow at some length,
and as that reply is rather difficult to obtain
I will give it here in full as quoted by Ferri,
and translated by Robert Rives La Monte:</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, there is no scientific
doctrine which proclaims more openly than
the theory of descent, that the equality of individuals,
toward which Socialism tends, is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
impossibility, that this chimerical equality is
in absolute contradiction with the necessary
and, in fact, universal inequality of individuals.</p>

<p>“Socialism demands for all citizens equal
rights, equal duties, equal possessions and
equal enjoyments; the theory of descent establishes,
on the contrary, that the realization of
these hopes is purely and simply impossible;
that in human societies, as in animal societies,
neither the rights, nor the duties, nor the
possessions, nor the enjoyments of all the
members of a society are or ever can be equal.</p>

<p>“The great law of variation teaches—both
in the general theory of evolution and in the
smaller field of biology where it becomes the
theory of descent—that the variety of phenomena
flows from an original unity, the diversity
of functions from a primitive identity,
and the complexity of organization from a
primordial simplicity. The conditions of existence
for all individuals are, from their very
birth, unequal. There must also be taken into
consideration the inherited qualities and the
innate tendencies, which also vary more or
less widely. In view of all this, how can the
work and the reward be equal for all?</p>

<p>“The more highly the social life is developed,
the more important becomes the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
principle of the division of labor, the more
requisite it becomes for the stable existence
of the state as a whole that its members should
distribute among themselves the multifarious
tasks of life, each performing a single function;
and as the labor which must be performed
by the individuals, as well as the expenditure
of strength, talent, money, etc.,
which it necessitates, differs more and more,
it is natural that the remuneration of this labor
must also vary widely. These are facts so
simple and so obvious that it seems to me
every intelligent and enlightened statesman
ought to be an advocate of the theory of
descent and the general doctrine of evolution
as the best antidote for the absurd equalitarian,
utopian notions of the Socialists.</p>

<p>“And it was Darwinism, the theory of selection,
that Virchow, in his denunciation, had
in mind, rather than the mere metamorphic
development, the theory of descent, with which
it is always confused! Darwinism is anything
rather than socialistic.</p>

<p>“If one wishes to attribute a political tendency
to this English theory—which is quite
permissible—this tendency can be nothing
but aristocratic; by no means can it be democratic,
still less socialistic.</p>

<p>“The theory of selection teaches that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
life of mankind, as in that of plants and animals,
it is always and everywhere a small and
privileged minority alone which succeeds in
living and developing itself; the immense majority,
on the contrary suffer and succumb
more or less prematurely. Countless are the
seeds and eggs of every species of plants and
animals, and the young individuals who issue
from them. But the number of those who
have the good fortune to reach fully developed
maturity and to attain the goal of their
existence is relatively insignificant.</p>

<p>“The cruel and pitiless ‘struggle for existence’
which rages everywhere through animated
nature, and which in the nature of
things must rage, this eternal and inexorable
competition between all living beings is an
undeniable fact. Only a small picked number
of the strongest or fittest is able to come forth
victoriously from this battle of competition.
The great majority of their unfortunate competitors
are inevitably destined to perish. It
is well enough to deplore this tragic fatality,
but one cannot deny or change it. ‘Many are
called, but few are chosen!’</p>

<p>“The selection, the ‘election’ of these ‘elect’
is by absolute necessity bound up with the
rejection or destruction of the vast multitude
of beings whom they survived. And so another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
learned Englishman has called the fundamental
principle of Darwinism ‘the survival
of the fittest, the victory of the best.’</p>

<p>“At all events the principle of selection is
not in the slightest degree democratic; it is,
on the contrary, thoroughly aristocratic. If
then, Darwinism, carried out to its ultimate
logical consequences, has, according to Virchow,
for the statesman ‘an extraordinarily
dangerous side’ the danger is doubtless that
it favors aristocratic aspirations.”</p>

<p>And now let us turn to the closing pages
of the second volume of Haeckel’s valuable
work, “The History of Creation.” We shall
find it interesting and instructive to observe
the nature of the argument which he there
uses with great effect against Virchow. Virchow
had delivered his celebrated address at
Berlin, which closed as follows: “It is absolutely
certain that Man is not descended from
apes.”</p>

<p>Haeckel takes this up, gives a resumé of the
facts known to zoology on this point, and then
winds up with the following: “In view of
this state of affairs, we zoologists, recognized
as authorities on the subject, may surely ask,
How can many so-called anthropologists still
maintain that there exists no sort of actual
proofs of the ‘Derivation of Man from Apes’?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
How can Virchow, Ranke, and others, who
are not zoologists, in the speeches they annually
deliver at anthropological and other congresses,
continue to declare that this ‘Pithecoid
thesis’ is an empty hypothesis, an unproved
assertion, and a mere dream of the
philosophers of nature? How can these anthropologists
still continue to ask for ‘certain
proofs’ of this thesis when proofs with all
the clearness that could be desired lie before
them, and are unanimously recognized by all
zoologists? As regards Virchow’s often
quoted declarations against the Pithecoid
thesis, they have obtained great favor in wide
circles, only because of the high authority
this famous naturalist enjoys in an entirely
different domain of science. His ‘cellular pathology,’
his ingenious application of the cell-theory
to the whole province of medicine,
introduced a grand advance in that branch of
science thirty years ago. This great and lasting
service rendered by him has, however, no
connection whatever with the unyielding and
negative position which, unfortunately, Virchow
persists in assuming towards the doctrine
of evolution.”</p>

<p>It probably never occurred to Haeckel that
the argument which he here uses to meet
Virchow’s opposition to evolution, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
serve quite as effectively as a reply to his
own opposition to Socialism.</p>

<p>As regards Haeckel’s “often quoted declarations
against” Socialism, “they have obtained
great favor in wide circles, only because of
the high authority which this famous naturalist
enjoys in an entirely different domain of
science. His biogenetic principle, discovered
in embryology, “introduced a grand advance
in that science thirty years ago. This great
and lasting service rendered by him has, however
no connection whatever with the unyielding
and negative position which, unfortunately,”
Haeckel “persists in assuming towards
the doctrine of” Socialism.</p>

<p>Haeckel’s complaint that Virchow could not
judge the merits of evolution because he was
not a zoologist, is well taken. But the Socialist
has as good or better right to assert that
Haeckel was incapable of estimating the relationship
of Socialism to Darwinism, for he certainly
knew a good deal less about Socialism
than Virchow knew of zoology.</p>

<p>This is precisely the trouble with Haeckel’s
criticism of what he calls Socialism. Of the
theories of Karl Marx and the modern scientific
Socialists, he knew absolutely nothing. The
Socialism he condemned had been abandoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
by the Socialists themselves, nearly thirty
years before his criticism was made.</p>

<p>“Absurd equalitarian notions,” granted; but
they were not even the sole property of the
utopian Socialists. They borrowed them from
the bourgeois revolutionists of 1789. It was
they who boasted of the equality they would
set up. That equality, which, as Engels says,
only “materialized in bourgeois equality before
the law.”—“The equality before the law
of all commodity-owners.” It was this
struggling bourgeoisie that adopted as its
catch-words, “liberty, fraternity, equality,”
and applied them to a typical bourgeois use
when they inscribed them above the entrances
to French prisons.</p>

<p>A significant clause in the second sentence
of Haeckel’s criticism is, “in human societies
as in animal societies,” the duties, etc., of the
members cannot be “equal.” The only possible
point this could have as a criticism of
Socialism, would be its use to deny the possibility
of abolishing social class divisions.
There is nothing to show whether Haeckel intended
it to have such a specific application,
but as any other application it might have
could be in no way opposed to the Socialist
position, I need only show its failure in that
regard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
“Bee” society may be said to have class
divisions, and it must be conceded that these
classes cannot be abolished by anything that
could, by any stretch of the imagination, be
called “bee socialism.” But the reason for this
is not far to seek and, when found, it makes
any argument by analogy, against Socialism,
impossible. Bee workers are “physiologically”
incapable of discharging any other function in
bee society. They are females, incapable of
maternity. As a result of this the queen bee
is obliged to shoulder the whole burden of the
reproduction of the species, and she is specialized
in this direction to such an extent, that
she could not possibly be a worker. The drone,
as the male breeder, is in the same fix, and
the popular notion that they are useless loafers,
has its origin in the bee custom of applying
the boot, or something worse, to all superfluous
members of the drone class.</p>

<p>“A hive of bees,” says Prof. Huxley, “is
an organic polity, a society in which the part
played by each member is determined by organic
necessities. Queens, workers, and drones
are, so to speak, castes divided from one another
by marked physical barriers.”</p>

<p>Says Ernest Untermann in his fine chapter
on this question, in “Marxian Economics”:
“Every textbook on natural history describes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the different orders. For instance, the societies
of bees are ‘monarchies’, those of ants ‘republics’.
But in either case, biological variation
determines the form of these societies.
Queen bees, drones, and workers are of organically
different structure and equipped
with different specialized organs. The queen
bee is equipped only for the duties of conception
and the laying of eggs. The drone
cannot perform any other function but that
of fertilizing the queen. The worker alone has
organs for gathering flower dust, honey, and
manufacturing wax.” Class divisions in bee
society are therefore “biological” and not
economic. But Haeckel’s comparison ignores
this vital distinction. Before this argument
can be used against the Socialist advocacy of
class abolition, it must be shown that a queen
cannot wash clothes with starvation as an
alternative, and that a pleb woman could not
wear a coronet, should her father invest in
a busted duke.</p>

<p>True there are other animal societies which
have no such biological division. But these
have no private property in the means of life,
and therefore no classes. Pelicans and crows
recognize only three grounds as justification
for idleness—infancy, old age and sickness or
accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
A recent Socialist writer said: “Take two
babies together—the worker’s baby and the
parasite’s baby. There they are, both of them,
out of the great mystery. Examine their soft
little bodies. Do you see spurs on the one
and a saddle on the other? And yet, one is
to grow up a profligate loafer, and the other
a starved and beaten worker. One to rot at
the top; the other to be stunted and oppressed
at the bottom.”</p>

<p>Of course these two babies would not be
equal, either actually or potentially, but is
that any reason why they should be given an
unequal start? How are we to find out which
is the best in any sense, if a multitude of opportunities
open to the one are to be closed to
the other?</p>

<p>And here Haeckel’s implied parallel breaks
down once more. In nature the strong and
capable survive in the struggle for existence;
nature gives something like a fair field and
no favor. But in capitalist society, a puling
son of a rich father is coddled to maturity,
and reproduces others of his kind; while the
lusty child of a worker is murdered by poisonous
milk, or debarred from marriage by low
wages.</p>

<p>In nature, “fittest” does not mean best in
any moral sense, except indirectly, as that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
practice of certain moral principles in animal
societies may constitute, or add to, fitness. But
in present society in a vast number of instances,
fitness does not mean “best” even to
the extent that such a word may be used in the
natural world.</p>

<p>A real estate “shark” is a libel on the fish.
An indispensable qualification in business is to
have few scruples and be a first-class liar.
Honesty and suicide are synonymous terms.</p>

<p>The statement that natural selection “favors
aristocratic aspirations,” involves the same fallacy.
It assumes that aristocrats are on top
because of fitness to be there. Recent revelations
in Berlin indicate that the aristocrats of
Haeckel’s own country are “fittest” for the
garbage can.</p>

<p>Haeckel’s main position is that “the struggle
for existence” in nature is a justification for
“competition” in society. To begin with,
Kropotkin has shown that Haeckel grossly
misrepresents nature when he speaks of “the
cruel, pitiless ‘struggle for existence’ which
rages everywhere throughout animated nature”
and “between all living beings.” When
this is used as a defense of present society, it is
equal to saying that human society should
seek its models among the lowest forms of
organic life rather than the highest. Haeckel’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
position was taken by Spencer and received
the following clever reply from Prof. Ritchie:
“The struggle among plants and the lower
animals is mainly between members of the
same species; and the individual competition
between human beings, which is so much admired
by Mr. Spencer, is of this primitive
kind.”</p>

<p>Kropotkin says: “If we ask nature ‘who are
the fittest, those who are continually at war
with each other, or those who support one
another?’ we at once see that those animals
which acquire habits of mutual aid are undoubtedly
the fittest.”</p>

<p>As to the desirability of that “pitiless struggle,”
Huxley pertinently says: “Of all the
shapes which society has taken, that most
nearly approaches perfection in which the war
of the individual against the individual is most
strictly limited.”</p>

<p>Whatever may be the truth among the
protozoa, we are safe in applying to society the
statement of Ruskin: “Co-operation is always
and everywhere the law of life; competition is
always and everywhere the law of death.”</p>

<p>Human society eventually reaches a point of
development where nature’s haphazard ways
are interfered with, and man arranges means
to an end. Professor Schiaparelli thought he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
saw canals on Mars, and inferred intelligent
inhabitants. The difference in water-ways, between
blind nature and a designing intelligence,
is the difference between a rambling
river and a straight canal.</p>

<p>Now human society has arrived at a stage
where its consciousness of itself and the possibility
of self-arrangement, becomes a factor.
This is a tremendous step forward, and its
future possibilities seem to be illimitable. Before
this can be largely effective, however, it
will be necessary to thoroughly understand all
fundamental social laws.</p>

<p>We had no rod to rule the lightning until we
knew the laws of its movement. There will be
no real airship until we master the laws of
aerial flight. Socialism solves the social
problem, not because it has, but because it
is, an explanation of the laws of social development
in general, and of existing society in
particular. On these laws our faith is founded.
By consciously arranging the social institutions
which so profoundly affect our lives, in
harmony with these laws, we shall cease to be
the slaves of a blind necessity.</p>

<p>As Engels has well said: “Man’s social
organization, hitherto confronting him as a
necessity imposed by Nature and history, now
becomes the result of his own free action. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
extraneous objective forces, that have hitherto
governed history, pass under the control of
man himself. Only from that time will man
himself more and more consciously, make his
own history—only from that time will the
social causes set in motion by him have, in
the main and in a constantly growing measure,
the results intended by him. It is the ascent
of man from the kingdom of necessity to the
kingdom of freedom.”</p>

<span class="subhead">SPENCER’S “SOCIAL ORGANISM.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The crowning generalization of modern
thought is that which presents the Universe as
a unity, inter-related in all its parts. By it,
the defenders of dualism are discredited, and
their theological, metaphysical philosophy is
thrown aside. It is no longer God and Man,
nor even Man and God, but Man only, with
God an anthropomorphic shadow, related to
man not as his creator, but as created by him.
God and Man are not “two,” but in reality
“one.”</p>

<p>Modern science has reversed the order of
their appearance, and also the order of their
dependence. That which seemed to our primitive
ancestors a living reality, a separate and
independent being, proves, when submitted to
the tests of anthropology and psychology, to
have been a creature of their own dreams.</p>

<p>And thus, as a result of scientific research
into the origin of dualism and the nature of
dreams, as Professor Clifford says: “The dim
and shadowy outline of the superhuman deity
fades slowly from before us; and as the mist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
of his presence floats aside, we perceive with
greater and greater clearness, the shape of a
yet grander and nobler figure—the figure of
him who made all Gods and shall unmake
them. From the dim dawn of history, and from
the inmost depths of every soul, the face of
our father man looks out upon us, with the fire
of eternal youth in his eyes, and says: ‘Before
Jehovah was, I am.’”</p>

<p>The thinker who would expand his intellectual
wings in this monistic atmosphere,
must possess not only a “discriminating” mind,
but also, as Marcus Hitch suggests, a “unifying”
mind. There are two errors he must
avoid; the creation of distinctions that do not
exist and the ignoring of distinctions that do.</p>

<p>The chief sinner against this first canon of
dialectical thinking is our old friend the theologian.
When the evolutionary naturalists
demonstrated the hopeless untruth of his
“revealed” legends about the origin of men
and things, he sought refuge in the ingenious
theory that these fables while scientifically indefensible
were, notwithstanding, spiritually
true. In short, scientific truth and spiritual
truth were so distinct as to have no vital relations.
These “artful dodgers” have relieved
controversial literature of much of its wonted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
heaviness and contributed generally to the
gaiety of the nations.</p>

<p>Socialists have always been among the first
to enjoy these entertaining performances, and
it seems like divine retribution when these
same theological and “Reverend” persons
tumble over into the Socialist camp and bring
their obsolete methods of thinking with them.</p>

<p>They dub themselves “Christian” Socialists
and proceed to show that “Socialism is a
philosophy concerning the social and economic
life of man, and not the religious at all.” When
Marx declared that political and legal and
other social institutions and ideas were the
result of economic conditions and class interests,
religious institutions and ideas were, of
course, exempt.</p>

<p>After a mental contortion like that, what is
to prevent a reconciliation between the 17th
century twaddle of the methodist pulpit and
the materialist conception of history?</p>

<p>Those who break the second canon given,
are not all theologians. Among those who
ignore distinctions that do exist, the biological
sociologist is entitled to conspicuous mention.</p>

<p>August Comte, who “attempted to make of
sociology a sort of transcendental biology,”
had at least this excuse that he wrote his
positivist philosophy before Darwin published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
his “Origin of Species” and, therefore, while
biology was yet in long clothes and sociology
was unborn. Although Comte is generally regarded
as the founder of sociology, these
limitations made it impossible to do little more
than invent the name and foresee its possibility.</p>

<p>These excuses, however, can scarcely be invoked
for Haeckel, who, as we have already
seen, wholly ignored in his inferences, fundamental
differences between the division of
labor in animal societies and that division in
human societies. Haeckel’s biological sociology
conveniently overlooks the rather important
fact that while a working bee can not by any
possibility act as a drone, the working man
has at least no physical disabilities to prevent
him from doing anything that pertains to the
role of a prince. Reasoning by analogy is
always dangerous, especially when the analogy
itself breaks down.</p>

<p>While it is well to keep these rules in mind,
it must be conceded that their critical application
is somewhat limited when we come to
Spencer’s famous analogy between animal
organisms and human societies. The “synthetic”
philosopher was much Haeckel’s
superior in sociology, and he possessed an
immense fund of biological lore that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
unavailable to Comte writing a quarter of a
century earlier.</p>

<p>Thus Spencer seems to recognize that his
essay on “The Social Organism” is largely an
ingenious analogy, from which conclusions
must be drawn with caution. Not that bourgeois
scientists have always exhibited a very
scientific temper in this regard. On the
contrary they have, on every possible occasion,
proclaimed that certain alleged truths in
physics or biology were in irreconcilable contradiction
to certain Socialist conclusions in
sociology.</p>

<p>But we may find a key to Spencer’s chariness
in the matter of drawing conclusions in the
rather surprising fact, which will appear
presently, that the one legitimate conclusion
which the analogy will thoroughly sustain, is
an exact contradiction to all that Spencer had
ever proclaimed on social questions.</p>

<p>The essay itself, like a great deal of
Spencer’s writing, is prolix and wearisome, so
we shall select only his most important and
striking comparisons.</p>

<p>The introduction is excellent and has for its
text Sir James Mackintosh’s great saying—great
in his non-evolutionary age though very
common-place today—“Constitutions are not
made, but grow.” He then declares “the central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
idea of Plato’s model republic” to be “the
correspondence between the parts of a society
and the faculties of the human mind.”</p>

<p>Hobbes, the philosopher of Malmesbury,
comes next with his celebrated “Leviathan.”
Hobbes sought to establish a still more definite
parallelism; not, however between a society
and the mind, but between a society and
the human body. Hobbes’ “Leviathan” was
the Commonwealth and he “carries this comparison
so far as to actually give a drawing of
the Leviathan—a vast human-shaped figure,
whose body and limbs are made up of multitudes
of men.”</p>

<p>Spencer criticizes these analogies of Plato
and Hobbes in detail, but finds the chief error
of both writers to consist in the assumption by
both “that the organization of a society is
comparable, not simply to the organization of
a living body in general, but to the organization
of a human body in particular. There is
no warrant whatever for assuming this. It is
in no way implied by the evidence; and is
simply one of those fancies which we commonly
find mixed up with the truths of early
speculation.” But, insists Spencer: “The untenableness
of the particular parallelisms above
instanced, is no ground for denying an essential
parallelism; since early ideas are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
usually but vague adumbrations of the truth.”</p>

<p>Lacking the great generalizations of biology,
it was, as we have said, “impossible to
trace out the real relations of special organizations
to organizations of another order.”
Therefore he proposes “to show what are the
analogies which modern science discloses.”</p>

<p>Spencer then discovers four points in which
an individual organism and a society agree,
and four in which they differ. The points of
agreement are:</p>

<p>(1.) “That commencing as small aggregations,
they insensibly augment in mass; some
of them eventually reaching ten thousand
times what they originally were.”</p>

<p>(2.) “That while at first so simple in
structure as to be considered structureless,
they assume in the course of their growth
a continually increasing complexity of
structure.”</p>

<p>(3.) “That though in their early, undeveloped
states, there exists in them scarcely
any mutual dependence of parts, their parts
gradually acquire a mutual dependence; which
becomes at last so great, that the activity and
life of each part is made possible only by the
activity and life of the rest.”</p>

<p>(4.) “That the life of a society is independent
of, and far more prolonged than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
lives of any of its component units; who are
severally born, grow, work, reproduce, and die,
while the body politic composed of them survives
generation after generation, increasing
in mass, in completeness of structure, and in
functional activity.”</p>

<p>The four points of difference are:</p>

<p>(1.) “That societies have no specific external
forms.”</p>

<p>(2.) “That though the living tissue whereof
an individual organism consists, forms a
continuous mass, the living elements of a society
do not form a continuous mass; but are
more or less widely dispersed over some portion
of the earth’s surface.”</p>

<p>(3.) “That while the ultimate living elements
of an individual organism are mostly
fixed in their relative positions, those of the
social organism are capable of moving from
place to place.”</p>

<p>(4.) “The last and perhaps the most important
distinction is, that while in the body
of an animal only a special tissue is endowed
with feeling, in a society all the members are
endowed with feeling.”</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that, while Spencer
finds the parallelisms to increase in significance
the more they are examined, the differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
tend to break down when they are worked out
in detail.</p>

<p>The advantage which Spencer had over
Plato and Hobbes is very clearly seen in the
first and fourth parallelisms, neither of which
could have been made until twenty-one years
before, when in 1839, Theodore Schwann developed
his great theory that the body is an
organized society of interconnected cells. “The
importance of this theory,” says Professor
Thatcher, “can hardly be estimated. It gave
an entirely new view to animal and vegetable
life.” At any rate, it served Spencer greatly
in this essay.</p>

<p>The next ten pages are devoted to organic
development from the protozoa, the lowest
tiny animal forms, to crustacea—crabs etc.,—which
are materially higher in the animal
scale. This development is marked by increasing
mutual dependence of parts and a growing
division of labor. It is compared to the development
of society from primitive Bushmen
to the early Anglo-Saxons, during which corresponding
phenomena are traced.</p>

<p>He escapes Haeckel’s blunder at least to the
extent of calling the two divisions of labor by
their proper names. Among animals it is the
“physiological” division of labor; in society,
the “economical” division of labor. Whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
he would have been able to still perceive that
distinction in dealing with those ant and bee
communities where Haeckel got lost, there is
nothing to show.</p>

<p>Spencer’s middle-class predilections come
out strongly, and a very pretty physiological
justification is provided for that wholly admirable
section of the community.</p>

<p>The first step in the development of an embryo
is its division into two main layers of
cells—the mucous layer and the serous layer.
The mucous layer, that fine inside skin of the
body so to speak, absorbs nutriment. But
that nutriment must be transferred to the
serous layer which builds up the nerves and
muscles. Presently there arises between these
two a third—the vascular layer. Out of this
third layer the chief blood vessels are developed
and these vessels serve to transport
the nutriment from the inner or mucous layer,
which gathers it, to the outer or serous layer,
which uses it for the whole organization’s upbuilding.</p>

<p>“Well,” says Spencer, “may we not trace a
parallel step in social progress? Between the
governing and the governed, there at first exists
no intermediate class; and even in some societies
that have reached considerable size,
there are scarcely any but the nobles and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
kindred on the one hand, and their serfs on the
other; the social structure being such that
transfer of commodities takes place directly
from slaves to their masters. But in societies
of a higher type, there grows up, between these
two primitive classes, another—the trading or
middle class. Equally at first as now, we may
see that, speaking generally, this middle class
is the analogue of the middle layer in the
embryo.”</p>

<p>It is a pity to disturb this serene complacency,
by pointing out that the real transporters
of commodities are not the members of
the middle class who, as a rule, do little and
live well, but that section of the working class
which mans freight trains, drives teams and
shoves trucks. As for that “higher” class of
cells which receives these commodities and
consumes them while usefully engaged in
building up the nervous and muscular system;
such comparison could only apply to society’s
brain workers, and it contains no justification
for the useless parasitic type represented by
such charming persons as Harry Thaw and
Reggie Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>Another very interesting point is Spencer’s
physiological vindication of profit. The limbs,
glands, or other members of an animal are developed
by exercise. But in order “that any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
organ in a living being may grow by exercise,
there needs to be a due supply of blood.” All
action implies waste; blood brings the materials
for repair; and before there can be
growth, the quantity of blood supplied must
be more than is requisite for repair.</p>

<p>“In a society it is the same. If to some
district which elaborates for the community
particular commodities—say the woolens of
Yorkshire—there comes an augmented demand;
and if in fulfillment of this demand, a
certain expenditure and wear and tear of the
manufacturing organization are incurred;
and if, in payment for the extra quantity of
woolens sent away there comes back only
such quantity of commodities as replaces the
expenditure, and makes good the waste of life
and machinery; there can clearly be no
growth. That there may be growth, the commodities
obtained in return must be more than
sufficient for these ends; and just in proportion
as the surplus is great will the growth be
rapid. Whence it is manifest that what in
commercial affairs we call profit, answers to
the excess of nutrition over waste in a living
body.”</p>

<p>This is “physiological” political economy
with a vengeance and shows to what straits
bourgeois apologists are reduced to find a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
justification of that exploitation of labor which
is the only source of profit. In concluding this
point Spencer seems to satirize his own position
and at the same time gives something that
looks very much like a socialist explanation of
panics. He says: “And if in the body politic
some part has been stimulated into great productivity,
and afterwards can not get paid for
all its produce, certain of its members become
bankrupt, and it decreases in size.”</p>

<p>The truth of the whole matter is that Spencer
is wholly at sea the moment he touches
political economy, and in place of some elementary
knowledge on that subject, we have
the obsolete theories of the Manchester School
proclaimed in the name of physiology.</p>

<p>Then follows a series of very ingenious comparisons.
Following Liebig, he compares coins
to blood corpuscles calling the later blood-discs
to enhance the analogy and concludes:
“throughout extensive divisions of the lower
animals, the blood contains no corpuscles; and
in societies of low civilization, there is no
money.”</p>

<p>Then the development of blood vessels in
lower animals is compared to the development
of roads in primitive societies; their greater
perfection in higher animals comparing with
the railroads which more effectively convey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
food stuffs to the centers of population. Amid
much that is fantastic and tedious, he says:
“And in railways we also see, for the first time
in the social organism, a system of double
channels conveying currents in opposite directions
as do the arteries and veins of a well-developed
animal.”</p>

<p>“We come at length,” says Spencer, “to the
nervous system.” This is by far the most interesting
item in Spencer’s catalogue, because
it is here that the evolutionary philosopher and
the Manchester School politician come into
open contradiction.</p>

<p>“We have now to compare the appliances by
which a society as a whole, is regulated, with
those by which the movements of an individual
creature are regulated.”</p>

<p>Beginning with the nervous systems of
lower animals he discovers their inferiority to
lie in the absence of a controlling center. The
lower Annulosa is composed of a series of ring-like
segments. Each ring has its own nerve
ganglia linked by connecting nerves, but “very
incompletely dependent on any general controlling
power. Hence it results that when the
body is cut in two, the hinder part continues
to move forward under the propulsion of its
numerous legs; and that when the chain of
ganglia has been divided without severing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
body, the hind limbs may be seen trying to
propel the body in one direction, while the
fore limbs are trying to propel it in another.”</p>

<p>As we move up in the animal world the
nervous system culminates in a centralized
brain, and similarly as society becomes more
complex, government appears.</p>

<p>And now the great apostle of the non-interference
of government with the life of society
is driven into the glaring contradiction of contending
that the highest animal organization
is that in which the brain, which he compares
to government in society, interferes and controls
most effectively.</p>

<p>“Strange as the assertion will be thought,”
he says, “our Houses of Parliament discharge,
in the social economy, functions which are in
sundry respects comparable to those discharged
by the cerebral masses in a vertebrate
animal.” Strange indeed! Especially to Mr.
Spencer’s disciples.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Spencer discovers that the kind of
brain activity displayed by the highest animals
best compares with that form of government
called “representative.”</p>

<p>He says: “It is the nature of those great
and latest-developed ganglia which distinguish
the higher animals, to interpret and combine
the multiplied and varied impressions conveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
to them from all parts of the system, and to
regulate the actions in such a way as duly to
regard them all; so it is in the nature of those
great and latest-developed legislative bodies
which distinguish the most advanced societies,
to interpret and combine the wishes of all
classes and localities and to make laws in
harmony with the general wants.”</p>

<p>It would seem from this that, a society
whose government represents only the interests
of a handful of the community while the
great majority are uncared for, is suffering
from social paralysis.</p>

<p>Before we pass to the next chapter where
we shall examine the position presented in
“The Man Versus The State” we will observe
one break in Spencer’s analogy which he fails
to notice.</p>

<p>When the brain of an animal is wrecked the
animal dies; it has no choice. But when the
brain of a society fails to represent the interests
of the mass of the people who compose
that society, or when the social brain runs
amuck and invites disaster, society may take
its choice, it may elect to die or—it may get
a new brain.</p>

<span class="subhead">SPENCER’S INDIVIDUALISM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Individualism is dead.</p>

<p>As a theory, it has gone with Stahl’s “Phlogiston,”
Cuvier’s “Cataclysms,” and Goethe’s
“Theory of Colors” to the museum of history.
The revolution in philosophy, which covers
the nineteenth century and reaches back into
the closing decades of the eighteenth, has met
and overthrown it at every point. Today it
lingers in the world of thought a reminiscence
of a prior stage of social development, as the
imperfect remnant of the “third eyelid” remains
in our bodies a surviving rudiment, a
legacy that links us with our extinct ancestors
of the silurian age.</p>

<p>The greatest name ever thrown into the
scales for Individualism and against Socialism
is that of Herbert Spencer. He has the reputation
of having been the greatest Individualist
of all times.</p>

<p>Many people, including Socialists, who are
not familiar with the works of Spencer wonder
how it comes to pass that the great evolutionary
philosopher could defend a theory so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
obsolete and anti-evolutionary as Individualism.
With this problem solved, Individualism
is practically disposed of—at least, its greatest
prop is gone.</p>

<p>All careful students of the works of the
“Synthetic” philosopher, eventually recognize
the dual personality of Mr. Spencer; the “Dr.
Jekyll” of evolution, and the “Mr. Hyde” of
Individualism.</p>

<p>The last chapter dealt mainly with the
former; this chapter will treat chiefly of the
latter.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer’s chief utterances against what
he conceived to be Socialism and in favor of
Individualism are to be found in a volume of
four essays entitled, “The Man Versus the
State.” In this book Mr. Spencer complains
bitterly of the rapid extension of government
interference in the England of his day. He
declares these “Acts of Parliament” to be a
greater and greater restriction of the individual
rights of the citizen.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the Acts which Spencer
denounced: An Act directing the Board of
Trade to record the draught of sea-going
vessels leaving port, and another to fix the
number of life-boats and the life-saving appliances
such vessels should carry. An Act
making illegal a mine with a single shaft: The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
inspection of white lead works to compel the
owners to provide overalls, respirators, baths,
acidulated drinks, etc., for the workmen: Providing
for the inspection of gas works: Making
compulsory regulations for extinguishing fires
in London; Taxing the locality for local drainage;
That bake-houses should have a periodical
lime washing, and a cleaning with soap and
hot water at least once in six months; To secure
decent lodgings for persons picking fruit
and vegetables for public consumption; To
provide free compulsory education and public
schools; The Public Libraries Act; All the
Factory Acts limiting child labor or enforcing
the protection of dangerous machinery; The
Preservation of Seabirds Act; The establishment
of state telegraphy; Proposals to feed
children; Government endowment of scientific
research; etc.</p>

<p>All these measures, and many others of
similar nature, excited the indignation of the
greatest prophet of Individualism because,
forsooth, they modified somebody’s right to
do as he pleased about something. Luckily
for England, Mr. Spencer and a handful of
his individualist disciples stood alone, while
the electorate carried these laws through their
highest tribunals.</p>

<p>One can imagine the “joy of living” in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
individualist arcadia fashioned after Mr. Spencer’s
own heart. A working man would be
able to take up the occupation of a sailor. He
could embark on the rotten old tub of some
greedy shipowner, insured for many times its
value, loaded to the gunwales and sure to sink
when it got out of sight of land to where the
water was a little rougher than plate glass.
Of course he would be living under a system
of “voluntary co-operation” and “freedom of
contract” and if he didn’t wish to go to sea
he could stay at home and—starve. There
would be very little work in port unloading
ships, as so many of them would never return
to be unloaded. When the insurance
money was paid the shipowner could give a
banquet and hold forth on the individual right
of the sailor to get drowned in the interests
of commerce without the government meddling
about life boats and other expensive and
nonsensical appliances.</p>

<p>If he preferred to work on “terra firma” he
might get a job in a mine with only one shaft
which in case of firedamp would be converted
into a furnace. Then as there would be no
way to get out, no socialistically inclined person
would be able to dispute his individual
right to stay in. If he preferred the white lead
industry he might “get in” there, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
being no respirators, baths, or acidulated
drinks he could be a physical wreck in a year
and a corpse in two. Or he might try the gasworks
and, there being no inspectors, there
would be nothing to interfere with his individual
right to be asphyxiated in an oven
or roasted in a retort.</p>

<p>As wages would be small, unions not being
individualist institutions, he might get a cheap
room in the top of an hotel without fire
escapes, in a town with no fire engines. He
could live cheaply on bread from bakehouses
that never knew lime washings and had not
seen hot water or soap for over six months,
and eat fruit and vegetables handled by people
who were not troubled with decent, let
alone sanitary, lodgings.</p>

<p>He would have the liberty to stay at manual
labor as there would be no public schools
or libraries to assist him to qualify for any
profession such as, for instance, journalism.
This would, no doubt, be a blessing in disguise,
for if he became a writer, instead of
following the brilliant example of Mr. Spencer,
he might misuse his powers to the detriment
of the race by advocating the limitation,
or even the abolition, of child labor. If he
married he might be at liberty to sew on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
own buttons, his wife having left her fingers
among the cogs of uncovered machinery.</p>

<p>Such would be the social heaven, operated
on the principles of the “Manchester” school
of politics, which mark the high-water of Individualism,
and of which Herbert Spencer
was the chief apostle.</p>

<p>Compare this attitude of mind with that of
the Utopian Socialist, Robert Owen, over
whom Spencer had the advantage of the lapse
of a period of seventy years. In 1815 Owen
convened a large number of cotton manufacturers
at Glasgow, Scotland, to consider the
state of the cotton trade which was then
in great distress. To that conference he
presented two proposals; one to help the
masters, the other to benefit the workers.
The first was that they should petition
parliament for the repeal of the tariff on
raw cotton; the second that they should request
parliament to shorten the working
hours, and otherwise improve the conditions
of workers in the mills. The first proposal
carried unanimously, but the one on which
Owen’s heart was set, was not even seconded.</p>

<p>Knowing as he did the terrible condition of
the English working class of that period, the
callous brutality of these rapacious masters
roused him to irony and defiance. He delivered
an address to the conference which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
had printed and spread broadcast in every
corner of the country.</p>

<p>This is how the lion turned on the jackals:</p>

<p>“True indeed it is that the main pillar and
prop of the political greatness and prosperity
of our country is manufacture, which, as now
carried on, is destructive of the health, morals,
and social comfort of the mass of people engaged
in it. It is only since the introduction
of the cotton trade that children, at an age
before they have acquired strength or mental
instruction, have been forced into the cotton
mills—those receptacles, in too many instances,
for living, human skeletons, almost
disrobed of intellect, where, as the business
is often now conducted, they linger out a
few years of miserable existence, acquiring
every bad habit which they may disseminate
throughout society. It is only since the introduction
of this trade that children and
even grown people were required to labor
more than twelve hours in a day, not including
the time allotted for meals. It is only
since the introduction of this trade that the
sole recreation of the laborer is to be found
in the pothouse or ginshop, it is only since
the introduction of this baneful trade that
poverty, crime, and misery have made rapid
and fearful strides throughout the community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
“Shall we then go unblushingly, and ask the
legislators of our country to pass legislative
acts to sanction and increase this trade—to
sign the death warrants of the strength, morals,
and happiness of our fellow-creatures,
and not attempt to propose corrections for
the evils which it creates? If such be your
determination, I, for one, will not join in the
application—no, I will, with all the faculties
I possess, oppose every attempt made to extend
the trade that, except in name, is more
injurious to those employed in it than is the
slavery of the poor negroes in the West Indies,
for deeply as I am interested in the cotton
manufacture, highly as I value the extended
political power of my country, yet
knowing as I do, from long experience both
here and in England, the miseries which this
trade, as it is now conducted, inflicts on those
to whom it gives employment, I do not hesitate
to say: Perish the cotton trade, perish
even the political superiority of our country,
if it depends on the cotton trade, rather than
that they shall be upheld by the sacrifice of
everything valuable in life.”</p>

<p>Compare these noble utterances of the great-souled
utopian Socialist with the sneers at
the most unfortunate element of the working
class which disfigure the pages of “The Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Versus the State” and let the Individualist
take whatever satisfaction he can get from
the contrast.</p>

<p>But Spencer’s reactionary views did not
stop with opposition to every attempt to alleviate
the condition of the wealth producers
of his day.</p>

<p>As an individualist, he would tolerate no
“government interference” with the rights of
individuals who wished to shoot sea-birds
which they could not get, but which usually
flew out to sea, and died floating, with a
broken wing. Why should these lofty minded
people be interfered with? Were they not the
prototypes of our own Roosevelt, who is always
ready to manifest his love of nature by
killing everything in sight?</p>

<p>What a pity these individualists were not
allowed to have the British telegraph system
managed by a gang of financial pirates like
the owners of the “Western Union” and the
“Postal” of this country.</p>

<p>State repression of knowledge having
proved such a bad thing in the middle ages,
state encouragement of learning must of
course, needs be equally bad in the nineteenth
century. “Government endowment of research,”
indeed! Not for the individualist
champion. And yet England holds the world’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
honors in biology, because of Darwin, whose
opportunity came through the government
exploration of “The Beagle,” and Huxley, who
began his brilliant career with the government
expedition of the “Rattlesnake.” As
England led the world in the middle of the
century so France had held first place during
its first quarter, and that because the French
government sent out scientific expeditions to
the tropics, which, on their return loaded
down the shelves of the “Jardin des Plantes”
with specimens which made possible those
greatest of her thinkers, Lamarck, Cuvier and
Geoffrey St. Hilaire.</p>

<p>When the feeding of school children is
thrown as a charge against Socialism, we are
proud to plead guilty. It is our glory that
the only cities in the world that have no starving
children behind school benches are those
cities such as Lille, Ivry, Montlucon, etc.,
with a Socialist majority in the town councils,
which removed the disgrace.</p>

<p>Such then were the arguments of this flag
bearer of Individualism, who has supplied the
opponents of Socialism with objections these
thirty years. His individualist philosophy is
now so thoroughly discredited as to call for
no answer were it not for the fact pointed out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
by Huxley, that erroneous ideas do not die
just simply because they have been killed.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to wheel into position
the heavy artillery of Marx to overthrow this
house of cards. Spencer is a sufficient reply
to Spencer.</p>

<p>Here is the great contradiction. Spencer,
the great biologist, says the brain is to the
animal what the Government is to a society.
(1) The more effectively and completely the
brain controls the members composing the
animal body, the higher its place in the organic
scale. (2) The less effectively and completely
the Government controls the members
of the body politic the better will be the society.</p>

<p>Sociological literature has failed to produce
any individualist champion able to reconcile
this astonishing contradiction. And so there
it stands plainly before the eyes of Mr. Spencer’s
readers.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” says Professor Huxley, “that, in
accordance with this view, each muscle were
to maintain that the nervous system had no
right to interfere with its contraction except
to prevent it from hindering the contraction
of another muscle; or each gland, that it had
a right to secrete, so long as its secretion interfered
with no other; suppose every separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
cell were left free to follow its own “interest”
and laissez-faire lord of all, what would come
of the body physiological? The fact is that
the sovereign power of the body thinks for the
physiological organism, acts for it, and rules
the individual components with a rod of iron.
Even the blood corpuscles can’t hold a public
meeting without being accused of “congestion”—and
the brain, like other despots
whom we have known, calls out at once for
the use of sharp steel against them.”</p>

<p>This is the rock upon which Spencerian Individualism
struck and went to pieces, independently
of those great forces, which I shall
point out, that made for its disintegration.</p>

<p>These two contradictory positions are the
upper and nether millstones between which
the individualistic philosophy of Anarchism is
ground to powder. Socialists are not stupid
enough to argue that because society can get
along without a king therefore an orchestra
should have “no head.” We are also able to
distinguish between “the state” which Socialism
will abolish, and the “administration of
industry” which it will establish.</p>

<p>Every step forward in modern thought has
emphasized the importance of that factor
called “environment.” The evolution philosophy
is an environment philosophy. Lamarck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the greatest pioneer of modern science, makes
a change of environment the prime necessity
of organic development. Darwin makes environment
the selective factor in “Natural Selection”
and in this he is supported by every
living biologist of note. Karl Marx paralleled
these great advances by discovering that every
political philosophy takes its origin in some
particular economic environment. This is true
of Socialism and Individualism alike.</p>

<p>And so if we wish to understand the historic
significance of Individualism we must go
back to the period of its birth and examine the
social processes of production of that day.
This takes us back to the early years of the
19th century.</p>

<p>In the closing half of the 18th century, laborers
individually owned the small and crude
tools by which they made their living. In this
stage of social development the laborer owning
the tools he used, appropriated the result.
There was here no contradiction and whatever
notion of justice is supposed to inhere in
the “individual ownership of the means of production”
derives its whole force from the economic
status of the worker of this period. If
that status had remained unchanged, Socialism
would never have been heard of. But in
the process of evolution the truth and justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of the 18th century became a lie and a social
wrong in the 19th.</p>

<p>This transformation was wrought by the
development of machinery. It was impossible
for every individual worker to own a large
machine, and so some men became toolless
wage laborers employed by the owners of machinery.
This is the beginning of the present
labor problem and here arises the struggle in
the world of ideas between the philosophy of
Individualism and that of Socialism.</p>

<p>Let us examine the vital change which had
taken place even before we reach the middle
of the last century. Now, one man uses the
tools, but another owns them and appropriates
the result. And this is the economic
foundation of the class war between the exploited
wage worker and the exploiting capitalist.</p>

<p>But the individualist theories proper to the
18th century, and its mode of wealth production,
passed over into the 19th where their
economic justification had ceased. As the fortunate
individual owners of machinery found
themselves growing rich at a great rate apart
from their own individual efforts, they became
enthusiastic supporters of “Individualism” and
eventually founded the “Manchester” school
of politics, which had Herbert Spencer as its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
chief mouth-piece and Henry George as a
somewhat belated trumpeter.</p>

<p>In this heyday of Individualism the “rate
of profit” was at its highest, one Lancashire
cotton spinner boasting of one thousand per
cent. But the social hell in which the English
working class of this period lived is without
parallel in modern times. Its system of child
labor, as recorded in the government blue
books as well as already shown by Owen,
was indescribably horrible, but the manufacturers
were opposed to “government interference”
and the individualist philosophy and its
bogey of “paternalism” was their craven plea.</p>

<p>With the grouping of the workers in factories
production became socialized, and now
came this contradiction, production was social
while ownership and appropriation were
individual. The Socialists of that period rightly
maintained that society should either go
back in production to the individual form so
as to be in harmony with the existing individual
form of ownership and appropriation,
or it should adopt social ownership and social
appropriation to harmonize with the already
existing social production.</p>

<p>But the wheel of history never revolves
backward, and the latter solution is destined
ultimately to prevail. Social evolution has already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
carried us far in that direction. With
the organization of capital individual ownership
disappeared and class ownership has
taken its place. The struggle of the 20th
century is not a struggle between individuals,
it is a struggle between classes, and so
Individualism has lost its meaning—it is
defunct.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the economic
foundation of Individualism, and the overthrow
of the philosophic superstructure erected
thereon, all its watchwords have lost their
power to charm. Free trade, free labor, free
contract, free competition; all these are the
lingering and belated echoes of a day that is
gone.</p>

<p>“Free trade” was the protest of the rising
capitalist class against the trammels placed
upon its commerce by the feudal regime.
Now it appears in a new role; it is the cry
of the small capitalist against those “predatory
trusts” which discovered that competition is
not the life but the death of trade, and are
using protection to destroy their weaker fellow-robbers.</p>

<p>“Free labor” was the demand of the capitalist
that the serf should be released from
the soil in the country so that he might be
available for exploitation in the factory, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the city. In England an attempt has been
made to give this defunct phrase a new lease
of life by the “Free Labor Association” an
organization which had this in common with
our “Citizen’s Alliance” that it sought to encourage
the dear good workingman to keep
out of the “tyrannical” labor unions.</p>

<p>“Freedom of contract” or, as it is sometimes
called “Voluntary Co-operation” never existed
in capitalist society and has never been
anything but a grim joke or a plain lie. Where
is the freedom or voluntaryism of the worker
who must work for what he can get or starve
like a dog in the street?</p>

<p>The effects of “free Competition” in England
in the early days of capitalism, where it
was most free, were such that none but a
fiend would wish them recalled. The “might
have been” halo with which present day individualists
seek to surround this principle, is
a midsummer night’s dream that never had
any existence in the world of reality and can
never be realized, except in the phantasmogoria
of their own ideological imaginations.</p>

<p>Individualism in all its forms has become
an anachronism. The deified ego of Max Stirner,
which imagines itself sitting enthroned
on the pinnacle of the universe, directing the
motions of the planet Jupiter by crooking its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
little finger, is an ideological phantasm, which
has no connection with the solid earth. The
flowery exhortations of Emerson, to live a
noble life in ignoble surroundings, is an invitation
to attempt what is, for the mass, impossible.
Any philosophy which proposes to
save the individual without transforming his
social environment stands condemned by modern
science.</p>

<p>If, with a society more highly organized
than any known to history, we still have anarchy
in the production and distribution of our
wealth, the remedy is, not less social organization,
but more. If with all our dental science
toothache still exists, the cure is not fewer
dentists, but more dentistry. The need of to-day
is not less society, but more social organization.
There is no hope in going back to the
small production of sixty years ago as Hearst
and Bryan desire. Increasing the number of
bandits in any society is not the concern of
their victims. The golden age of labor is not
in the past but in the future. The labor problem
cannot be solved by going back to the
scramble of the hog-pen or the methods of
the jungle. There is no succour in flying at
each other’s throats in the name of business.</p>

<p>Freedom cannot live in a society rent by
class wars. Her conquests are only possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
with a humanity united to subdue the cosmic
world by which it is interprenetrated and surrounded.</p>

<p>Happily for us, society evolves independently
of anybody’s opinion. Our opinions follow
blindly and gropingly in the rear. The
opinions of individualists do not manufacture
social laws, according to certain ethical requirements;
they interpret and explain those
laws which they discover in operation. The
fundamental question is not, “is Individualism
better than Socialism?” but “Is society moving
in the direction of the one or the other?”</p>

<p>To answer this question it is only necessary
to compare the world of to-day with that of
ten or even five years ago. America moves
steadily toward Socialism, while Europe advances
in great leaps. Every civilized country
tells the same story, and the recent development
of Finland and Austria astonished the
world.</p>

<p>Society moves forward, as irresistibly as
the ocean tides, and it moves in a direction
predicted by those greatest thinkers of this
or any age—the men who linked their lives
with the blood and the tears and the struggles
of half a century in the greatest cause that
ever throbbed in the brain of man—the cause
of Socialism.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the darkest curses that has fallen
on the working class is its being shut out of
the wondrous world of modern thought. The
great gates of the Temple of Science are
clanged in its face, and its mind is fed on the
theological garbage of the Middle Ages. In
the school, the press, and especially the pulpit,
ideas are gravely presented as serious
truths, which are known by all university men
to be thoroughly exploded lies.</p>

<p>A twentieth century newspaper will brazenly
devote a whole page to presenting, with
pictorial illustrations, alleged recently discovered
proofs of the truth of that Genesis legend
which has done such loyal service to the ruling
class by stultifying the brains of its victims.
These hypocritical displays are never
publicly contradicted, although every man
with the least smattering of scientific knowledge,
including the editors, knows how utterly
false they are. These worthies indulge in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
sly grin and lower one eyelid, for it is generally
understood among them that the great
donkey—the working class—will only consent
to carry everybody’s burdens in addition
to its own, just so long as it is kept in childish
ignorance of everything it ought to know.</p>

<p>And this is not all. Now that a great body
of workingmen are discarding these ancient
lies, and groping for those great truths that
contain the germs of their redemption, the official
savants, true servants of the ruling class,
twist and warp their own science in order to
make it contradict every working class idea.</p>

<p>This attitude of the time serving intellectual
lackeys of the professorial chairs has
brought with it another blighting curse—it
has made a considerable number of working
men suspicious of modern science itself. It is
an old-time tragedy, this breaking with one’s
best friend because of the groundless calumnies
of an interested enemy.</p>

<p>This terribly mistaken antagonism to science
has unfortunately found its way, in some
measure, into the Socialist movement, though
happily, increasing acquaintance with Socialism’s
classic literature is breaking it down.
In this connection the following passage from
the pen of Isador Ladoff is very pertinent:</p>

<p>“Rationalistic modern Socialism is based,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
not exclusively on certain economic theories
and maxims, as some narrow-minded ‘Socialists
pure and simple’ think and would fain
make us believe, but on the broad foundation
of modern science and thought. The economic
theories peculiar to modern Socialism are derived
from the application of the results of the
achievements of modern knowledge and philosophy
to the field of social economics. The
trouble with the ‘Socialists pure and simple’
is in the extreme limitation of their mental
horizon. They happen to know, or rather
imagine they have mastered Marxian economics,
while modern science and philosophy remains
to them a sealed letter. That is why
they get irritated whenever and wherever they
meet in the socialistic press an article containing
something else than the everlasting
parrot-like repetitions of pseudo-socialistic
commonplaces and shibboleths. Every attempt
to present to the attention of the readers of
socialistic publications, glimpses of the radiant
world of science and philosophy, leading
up to socialistic ideas and ideals in all their
world-redeeming significance, appears to the
simpleminded and superstitious simon-pure
Socialists as an attack on somebody or something,
as a heresy and heterodoxy of some
kind. To such people the religion of science<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
is the religion of ignorance and vice versa,
ignorance is their religion and science.”</p>

<p>The use of science and philosophy by the
ruling class as a pretence for the appropriation
of the lion’s share of the wealth produced
by labor does not prove that workingmen
should abandon philosophy as useless to their
cause. On the contrary, as Dietzgen says:
“Philosophy is a subject which closely concerns
the working class,” and he adds: “This,
of course, does by no means imply that every
workingman should try to become acquainted
with philosophy and study the relation between
the idea and matter. From the fact
that we all eat bread does not follow that we
must all understand milling and baking. But
just as we need millers and bakers, so does
the working class stand in need of keen scholars
who can follow up the tortuous ways of
the false priests and lay bare the inanity of
their tricks.”</p>

<p>It is quite clear that working men, instead
of underestimating the value of mental training,
should remember what a terrible weapon
it has proved in the hands of their enemies.
It is precisely because the workers have lacked
this weapon, that in spite of their overwhelming
numbers and physical strength,
they have always been outwitted. “The emancipation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
of the working classes,” concludes
Dietzgen, “requires that they should lay hold
on the science of the century.”</p>

<p>Lester F. Ward, whose theories we shall
now examine, warns us against the erroneous
supposition “formerly quite prevalent,” that
“science consists in the discovery of facts.”
He maintains that “there is not a single science
of which this is true, and a much more
nearly correct definition would be that science
consists in reasoning about facts.”</p>

<p>We may recall here that learned body which
sneered at Darwin as “a mere theorizer” and
conferred its honors upon an unknown man
who had collected some facts about butterflies
but had carefully avoided “reasoning
about them.” Of course the value of this reasoning
is that it leads to the discovery of those
laws or generalizations which reveal the relation
of the facts to each other, and thus enables
us to appreciate their real significance.</p>

<p>Therefore we might venture to push the
matter a little further and define science as
the discovery of laws. But for the uniformity
and invariability of physical phenomena, astronomy
would be impossible. The discovery
of evolution laid the foundations of modern
biology. Dalton’s theory of atoms and Lavoisier’s
permanence of matter emancipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
chemistry from the superstitions of alchemy.</p>

<p>Ward is therefore on solid ground when he
maintains that “the indispensable foundation
of all economic and social science” consists
in the fact that “all human activities and all
social phenomena are rigidly subject to natural
law.” It is just the difficulty of discerning
uniform laws amidst the highly complex
phenomena of society that delays the proper
development of sociology, although, as we
have seen, this difficulty is materially augmented
by the class interests at stake.</p>

<p>Again, just as biology was hindered in its
growth by the doctrine of special creations
and, still earlier, Copernican astronomy was
checked by the geocentric theory, so now the
progress of sociology is restrained by the doctrine
of divine providence. Believers in divine
providence are well represented by the Hindoo
who in his lesson on English composition
spoke of his father as having “died according
to the caprice of God which passeth all understanding.”</p>

<p>It is precisely because “caprice” can not be
understood and cannot therefore, be made the
basis of prevision, that it can not be admitted
into the domain of science. Science, as Starcke
well said, is founded on “faith in the universality
of causation.” If the activities of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
and the policies of nations are not ruled by
cause and effect a science of society is impossible.</p>

<p>And yet, contends Ward, it was the very
adoption of this “altogether sound abstract
principle” that “led to the greatest and most
fundamental of all economic errors, an error
which has found its way into the heart of
modern scientific philosophy, widely influencing
public opinion, and offering a stubborn
resistance to all efforts to dislodge it.”</p>

<p>And now we come to the keynote of Ward’s
whole system and at the same time to the
point where he completely breaks with the
biological sociologists. The error, which Ward
attributes to them all, the refutation of which
is the main object of his work, is described
as follows:</p>

<p>“This error consists in practically ignoring
the existence of a rational faculty in man,
which, while it does not render his actions
any less subject to natural laws, so enormously
complicates them that they can no
longer be brought within the simple formulas
that suffice in the calculus of mere animal motives.
This element creeps stealthily in between
the child and the adult, and all unnoticed
puts the best laid schemes of economists
and philosophers altogether aglee. A great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
psychic factor has been left out of the account,
the intellectual or rational factor, and
this factor is so stupendous that there is no
room for astonishment in contemplating the
magnitude of the error which its omission has
caused.”</p>

<p>This is the foundation stone of Ward’s sociology.
With great care he elaborates the
vital difference between the economy of nature
with its blind forces, and the economy of
society with its mental arrangement of means
to ends. He marshals that well-known array
of facts which prove the tremendous waste
continually going on in the natural world.</p>

<p>According to M. Quatrefages, two successive
generations of a single plant-louse would
cover eight acres. A large chestnut tree in
June contains as much as a ton of pollen.
Considering the size of pollen-grain the number
on such a tree would be next to inconceivable.
Burst a puff-ball and there arises
from it a cloud that fills the air for some distance
around. This cloud consists of an almost
infinite number of exceedingly minute
spores, each of which should it by the rarest
chance fall upon a favorable spot, is capable
of reproducing the fungus to which it belongs.</p>

<p>And yet in spite of all this enormous reproductivity
the population of these species remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
practically stationary. Ward objects
very strongly to this insane waste of nature
being set up as a model for human society,
and he is entitled to the sympathy of Socialists
who have always protested against the
planless anarchy of capitalist production,
which however, bad as it is, can hardly be
considered a circumstance compared with the
random waste of nature.</p>

<p>“The waste of being,” says Asa Gray, “is
enormous, far beyond the common apprehension.
Seeds, eggs, and other germs, are designed
to be plants and animals, but not one
of a thousand or a million achieves its destiny.”
And Gray quotes with approval from
an article in the Westminster Review: “When
we find that the sowing is a scattering at
random, and that for one being provided for
and living, ten thousand perish unprovided
for, we must allow that the existing order
would be considered the worst disorder in any
human sphere of action.”</p>

<p>Ward, of course, takes the same view: “No
one will object to having nature’s methods
fully explained and exposed, and thoroughly
taught as a great truth of science. It is only
when it is held up as a model to be followed
by man and all are forbidden to ‘meddle’ with
its operations that it becomes necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
protest. I shall endeavor still further to show
that it is wholly at variance with anything
that a rational being would ever conceive of,
and that if a being supposed to be rational
were to adopt it he would be looked upon as
insane.”</p>

<p>“Such,” says Ward, “is nature’s economy.
How different the economy of a rational being!
He prepares the ground, clearing it of
its vegetable competitors, then he carefully
plants the seeds at the proper intervals so that
they shall not crowd one another, and after
they have sprouted he keeps off their enemies
whether vegetable or animal, supplies water if
needed, even supplies the lack of chemical constituents
of the soil, if he knows what they
are, and thus secures, as nearly as possible,
the vigorous growth and fruition of every seed
planted. This is the economy of mind.”</p>

<p>And now Ward presents a truth that is very
familiar to all Socialists—that the difference
between an animal living in a state of nature
and man living in human society, is that man
is a tool using animal. This use and development
of tools is due to that application of
reason called the inventive faculty, which no
other animal possesses. “The beaver indeed,
builds dams by felling trees, but its tools are
its teeth, and no further advantage is taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
than that which results from the way the muscles
are attached to its jaws. The warfare
of animals is waged literally with tooth and
nail, with horn and hoof, with claw and spur,
with tusk and trunk, with fang and sting—always
with organic, never with mechanical
weapons.”</p>

<p>And because man can invent tools and improve
them he has an immense advantage over
other animals. It is this advantage which the
biological sociologists have overlooked. But
this advantage makes an incalculable difference.
The fundamental difference is, that “the
environment transforms the animal, while man
transforms the environment.”</p>

<p>What, then, is civilization? It is human
development beyond the animal stage. What
it its chief factor? It is psychic—the application
of “mind” to the problems of life.</p>

<p>Now we see still further how Ward is irresistibly
driven, by the logic of his position,
to Socialist conclusions. He sees that another
striking difference between irrational nature
and rational society is that nature is competitive,
while society is increasingly co-operative.
And this co-operation is due to the
greater development of that psychic factor,
which is the chief instrument of civilization
and leads men to avoid waste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
Turning now to “Pure Sociology,” we are
told that the subject-matter of sociology is
“human achievement.” When we ask, in what
does this achievement consist, we are informed
that: “Achievement does not consist in
wealth. Wealth is fleeting and ephemeral.
Achievement is permanent and eternal.”</p>

<p>Again the sum total of the things which
constitute achievement may be summed up in
the one word “inventions.”</p>

<p>Achievement with Ward is another name
for civilization. Page after page is given to
an enumeration of its particulars,—music,
painting, poetry, exploration, industry and
many other things which we have not space
even to mention. The one thing that is vital
here is that “achievement,” while it does not
include perishable wealth, nor yet the actual,
perishable machinery by which the wealth has
been produced, does nevertheless undoubtedly
include that something described by Socialists
as the “process of production.”</p>

<p>This is of prime importance because now
when we turn to Ward’s “Applied Sociology,”
we find that not only achievement, but “improvement”
is the theme of that branch of the
science.</p>

<p>And now listen to this great American sociologist,
who has so far outstripped all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
contemporaries as to be practically without a
rival, this thinker whose monumental works
have gained him an international reputation;
listen and compare what follows with the
hocus-pocus that usually comes from the official
chairs:</p>

<p>“The purpose of applied sociology is to
harmonize achievement with improvement.
If all this achievement which constitutes civilization
has really been wrought without
producing any improvement in the condition
of the human race, it is time that the reason
for this was investigated. Applied sociology
includes among its main purposes the investigation
of this question. The difficulty lies in
the fact that achievement is not socialized.
The problem, therefore, is that of the socialization
of achievement.</p>

<p>“We are told that no scheme for the equalization
of men can succeed; that at first it was
physical strength that determined the inequalities;
that this at length gave way to the
power of cunning, and that still later it became
intelligence in general that determined
the place of individuals in society. This last,
it is maintained is now, in the long run, in the
most civilized races and the most enlightened
communities, the true reason why some occupy
lower and others higher positions in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
natural strata of society. This, it is said, is
the natural state and is as it should be. It is
moreover affirmed that being natural there is
no possibility of altering it.</p>

<p>“Of course all this falls to the ground on
the least analysis. For example, starting
from the standpoint of achievement, it would
naturally be held that there would be great
injustice in robbing those who by their superior
wisdom had achieved the great results
upon which civilization rests and distributing
the natural rewards among inferior persons
who had achieved nothing. All would assent
to this. And yet this is in fact practically what
has been done. The whole history of the world
shows that those who have achieved have
received no reward. The rewards for their
achievement have fallen to persons who have
achieved nothing. They have simply for the
most part profited by some accident of position
in a complex, badly organized society,
whereby they have been permitted to claim
and appropriate the fruits of the achievements
of others. But no one would insist that these
fruits should all go to those who had made
them possible. The fruits of achievement are
incalculable in amount and endure forever.
Their authors are few in number and soon
pass away. They would be the last to claim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
an undue share. They work for all mankind
and for all time, and all they ask is that all
mankind shall forever benefit by their work.”</p>

<p>And so Ward’s conclusion is that the greatness
of the present consists in that mass of
achievements called civilization, among which
are those inventions which have so wonderfully
increased the capacity of social labor in
its production of wealth. And the hope of the
future lies in the socialization of those achievements
so as to make their rich fruits the common
heritage of all mankind. There are no
Socialists who will quarrel with these conclusions.</p>

<p>We will now briefly compare this position
with that of the great German thinker, Joseph
Dietzgen, who at the international congress
at The Hague, in 1872, was introduced by
Karl Marx to the assembled delegates with
these words: “Here is our philosopher.” Of
course we shall only deal with his theories
here as they relate to the conclusions reached
by Ward.</p>

<p>“All exertion and struggle in human history”
says Dietzgen, “all aspirations and researches
of science find their common aim in
the freedom of man, in the subjection of nature
to the sway of his mind.”</p>

<p>This is, as we have seen, precisely Ward’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
idea of what constitutes the substance of civilization.</p>

<p>“Man, to be sure,” says Dietzgen, “is still
dependent on nature. Her tribulations are not
yet all overcome. Culture has yet a good deal
to do; aye, its work is endless. But we have
so far mastered the dragon, that we finally
succeeded in forging the weapon with which
it can be subdued; we know the way to tame
the beast into a useful domestic animal.”</p>

<p>What is this “weapon” which humanity has
forged and which constitutes the possibility
of its salvation? “This salvation,” says Dietzgen,
“was neither invented nor revealed, it has
grown of the accumulated labor of history.
It consists in the wealth of to-day which arose
glorious and dazzling in the light of science,
out of human flesh and blood, to save humanity.
This wealth in all its palpable reality, is
the solid foundation of the hope of social-democracy.”</p>

<p>And here lest there should seem to be a
plain contradiction between Dietzgen and
Ward, we will go further and see that Dietzgen,
like Ward, does not mean merely those
items of wealth which happen to be in existence
in the shape of tangible commodities.</p>

<p>“The wealth of to-day does not consist in
the superb mansions, inhabited by the privileged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
of society, nor does it consist in their
costly apparel, or in the gold and precious
stones of their jewelry, or in the heaps of
goods peeping through the show windows of
our great cities. All that as well as the coin
and bullion in the trunks and safes form but
an appendix or, so to speak, the tassels and
tufts, behind which is concealed that great and
real wealth—the rock on which our hope is
built.</p>

<p>“What authorizes the people to believe in
the salvation from long ages of torture—nay,
not only to believe in, but to see it, and actively
strive for, is the fairy-like productive
power, the prodigious fertility of human labor.
In the secrets which have been wrung
from nature; in the magic formulas by which
we force her to do our wishes and to yield
her bounties almost without any painful work
on our part; in the constantly increasing improvement
of the methods of production—in
this I say consists the wealth which can
accomplish what no redeemer ever could.”</p>

<p>And Dietzgen, like Ward, protests against
this great legacy of history, this vast accumulation
of the results of the combined social
labor of a hundred generations, being the sole
property of those “who never achieved anything!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Dietzgen, like Ward, sees that the great
problem which confronts the race is to break
down those intolerable bars which prevent
humanity from entering into its just inheritance.</p>

<p>To this great and culminating task man
must bend all the powers of his mind. Now
he has reached the point where the gates of
liberty begin to yield and with one grand,
united effort may be thrown wide open so
that all the sons and daughters of men may
finish the long centuries of misery and freely
enter in.</p>

<p>To continue this senseless oppression longer
would be the summit of stupidity.</p>

<p>“Consider the frugal needs of our people
and at the same time the fertility of labor,
and ask yourselves if mere instinct alone
would not be sufficient to teach us how to
supply adequately our needs with the help of
the existing means of production?”</p>

<p>To make these “means of production the
property of society” is then the problem of
Ward’s applied sociology and Dietzgen’s social
democracy alike. According to both, this
emancipation of the mass of the people from
the last form of slavery is the one consuming
task of civilization.</p>

<p>And the psychic factor, the consciously reasoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
brain of man is, according to both, to
be more than ever the instrument of “achievement.”</p>

<p>To Dietzgen especially, the time is rotten-ripe
for the great change.</p>

<p>“The salvation of humanity is involved in
this question. It is so great and sublime that
all other problems which time may bear in
its folds must wait in silence. The whole of
old Europe is waiting with bated breath the
fulfilling of the things which are coming.</p>

<p>“Oh, ye short-sighted and narrow-minded,
who can not give up the fad of moderate, slow,
organic progress! Do you not perceive that all
your great liberal passions sink to the level
of mere trifling, because the great question of
social salvation is on the order of the day?
The calm precedes the tempest. History
stands still, because she gathers force for a
great catastrophe.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="THE_LEWIS_LECTURES">THE LEWIS LECTURES.</h2>
</div>

<p>This book, <b>Evolution, Social and Organic</b>,
is the first volume of a series of lectures to
which we expect to make notable additions in
the future. We can at this time definitely
promise two volumes, which will be made up
from the lectures delivered by Mr. Lewis at the
Garrick Theater during the winter and spring
of 1908.</p>

<p><b>Ten Blind Leaders of the Blind.</b> This will
in all probability be the second volume of the
Lewis Lectures, and we expect to publish it in
May or June. It will consist of critical studies
of the theories of such reformers, philosophers
and moralists as Benjamin Kidd, Henry
George, Dr. Schaeffle, Thomas Carlyle, Auguste
Comte and Immanuel Kant.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that Mr. Lewis in
these lectures is merely attempting to refute
these thinkers, nor that he would disparage the
service that each in his time has rendered. On
the contrary his aim is to give the reader as
clear a comprehension as possible of what each
of these men has achieved. And he furthermore
shows how the outlook of each was
limited by the economic environment from
which flowed the mental atmosphere in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
he lived, so that it would have been unreasonable
for us to expect from these writers any
other conclusions than those at which they
actually arrived. Understanding these conditions
we can better understand how to meet
the arguments of those still influenced by the
outgrown ideas which are perhaps best stated
in the writings of the leaders here considered.</p>

<p><b>Socialism and Modern Thought.</b> This is
planned for the third volume of the series, and
will probably be ready in the summer or fall of
1908. It will be a direct supplement to this
present volume, <b>Evolution, Social and Organic</b>,
which explains the scientific basis on which
socialism rests. The second volume, as we
have shown, is taken up with an examination
of rival theories. The third volume will restate
the principles of socialism and show how they
are applied to the pressing problems of today.
A lecture on “The Economic Interpretation of
History” will show how Marx’s historical
method throws a search-light on the darkest
places in which sociological students have
hitherto groped. One on “The Positive School
of Criminology” will tell how the socialist
scholars of Italy have revolutionized the once
hopeless science of crimes and punishments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
and have established certain very definite and
very fruitful propositions, showing all the
while that crime must last while capitalism
lasts. In “The Latest Word of Science and
Philosophy—Monism,” Mr. Lewis will show
how the clearest thinkers in the modern socialist
movement have arrived at a conception of
the universe that is broad enough to take in all
reality, and to show the relation of the facts
of mind to the facts of matter. We have room
to mention here but one more lecture, and
that shall be “The Inevitability of the Triumph
of Socialism.”</p>

<p>Each of these volumes will be uniform with
the present one; advance orders are solicited.
The price, postage included, will be fifty cents
each.</p>

<p><b>The Art of Lecturing.</b> Mr. Lewis had persistently
been urged to teach a class in the art
of lecturing, but the many demands on his time
made this quite out of the question, and as the
best way to satisfy his friends, he wrote a series
of brief articles for the Chicago Daily Socialist,
each article containing some practical suggestions
for young socialist speakers, each suggestion
the direct fruit of the author’s personal
experience. These articles at once attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
wide attention, and long before they had all
appeared, there was an unmistakable demand
for their publication in book form. That is
why this book is issued. There is nothing else
quite so helpful for the young man or woman
who expects to lecture on the socialist platform.
And many others who have no thought of lecturing
will enjoy reading the book, because it
brings the reader into such close touch with the
personality of a man worth knowing. Paper,
25c, postpaid.</p>

<p><b>The Standard Socialist Series.</b> This volume
is a fair sample of the twenty-five socialist
books already published in this library. In
their selection, the object of the publishers has
been in so far as possible to include all the
greatest works by European and American
socialists that could possibly be brought within
the limits of a fifty-cent volume. Of course the
series includes the <b>Communist Manifesto,</b> by
Marx and Engels. This, by the way, is published
in two editions, in one of which is also
printed Liebknecht’s work on socialist tactics
entitled <b>No Compromise</b>, while the other includes
a version of the Manifesto in Esperanto,
the new international language, as well as the
English version. The Standard Socialist Series<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
also includes Marx’s <b>Revolution and Counter-Revolution</b>,
and three of the most important
works of Frederick Engels, <b>Socialism: Utopian
and Scientific</b>, <b>The Origin of the Family, Private
Property and the State</b>, and <b>Feuerbach:
The Roots of the Socialist Philosophy</b>. As for
living socialist writers, France is represented
in this library by Lafargue’s <b>Social and Philosophical
Studies</b> and <b>The Right to Be Lazy and
Other Studies</b>, Germany by Kautsky’s <b>The Social
Revolution</b> and <b>Ethics and the Materialist
Conception of History</b>, Italy by Ferri’s <b>The
Positive School of Criminology</b>, Russia by Plechanoff’s
<b>Anarchism and Socialism</b>, Belgium by
Vandervelde’s <b>Collectivism and Industrial Evolution</b>,
England by Blatchford’s <b>Britain for the
British</b>, and America by the writings of Isador
Ladoff, Roberts Rives LaMonte, A. M. Simons,
John Spargo, Ernest Untermann, John M.
Work and others. Full descriptions of all these
books, together with an account of our other
books at higher and lower prices and suggestions
as to the choice of books, together with
some interesting propaganda matter, will be
found in the current issue of the Socialist Book
Bulletin, mailed free to any one requesting it.</p>

<p><b>How to Get Books at Cost.</b> This Bulletin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
also explains our co-operative plan for supplying
books at cost. The publishing house which
issues this volume is not owned by any capitalist.
It is owned by 1,900 socialist working
people, each of whom has subscribed ten dollars
to help publish more socialist books. No
dividends are paid; the advantage to the stockholder
is that instead of paying fifty cents for
a book like this one he pays twenty-five cents
if he calls at our office for it, or thirty cents if
it is mailed to him. More stockholders are
needed to provide the capital for publishing
more books, and readers of this book are urged
to co-operate with us to the extent of buying
a share at ten dollars. We do not care to sell
more than one share to one subscriber, but any
one having more than ten dollars to invest can
get four per cent interest on it and have the
money returned to him at any time on thirty
days’ notice. These terms are better than are
offered by Chicago banks, and the lender has
the satisfaction of knowing that his money is
used for the interests of the working class and
not against them.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
